<p>While Green Lantern's long-time nemesis never ceases to cause trouble for his emerald hued arch-enemy, he still manages to find the time to keep his upper lip groomed in a style that mixes a close-trimmed fade in the middle with fine, waxed tips. (While I would love adopt this style for myself as I grow my own 'mo this month, I've got to think it's next to impossible to pull this off in real life without looking like a total choad&hellip; or super-villain.)    <br /><br />The Warriors Three</p>

<p>If you are thinking of playing this game today on your PS3, I hope you have set up the download and install already, because depending on your bandwidth, this thing is going to take some time to get going. First you will have to download the 130MB PS3 patch, then install the 11GB worth of Universe, and then there will be another 2GB download before you start crushing the Joker's face in. Regardless, it looks like it will be worth the wait.</p>

<p>This game has cost $50M to produce, and looks like one of the most explosive and thought out games to hit the online universe ever. Warner Bros, DC, and Sony have high hopes for this online experience, and believe they can take on the World of Warcraft numbers. I have yet to dive into this Universe, so my enthusiasm is purely based on being a big fan of DC and hoping that this game lives up to the hype! I highly doubt the powers that be will ruin this one, but I did see The Green Lantern trailer, so I'm not saying they aren't capable of failure.</p>

<p>If you are thinking of playing this game today on your PS3, I hope you have set up the download and install already, because depending on your bandwidth, this thing is going to take some time to get going. First you will have to download the 130MB PS3 patch, then install the 11GB worth of Universe, and then there will be another 2GB download before you start crushing the Joker's face in. Regardless, it looks like it will be worth the wait.</p>

<p>This game has cost $50M to produce, and looks like one of the most explosive and thought out games to hit the online universe ever. Warner Bros, DC, and Sony have high hopes for this online experience, and believe they can take on the World of Warcraft numbers. I have yet to dive into this Universe, so my enthusiasm is purely based on being a big fan of DC and hoping that this game lives up to the hype! I highly doubt the powers that be will ruin this one, but I did see The Green Lantern trailer, so I'm not saying they aren't capable of failure.</p>

<p>I personally wasn't a huge fan of ""Inception,"" I thought ""The Social Network"" was much better. Anyway, the Golden Globes will be airing this weekend, so if you feel inclined to watch people get awards, check out NBC around 8pm.</p>

<p>Does the idea of a wisecracking Seth Rogen disguised as an underworld heavyweight in a domino mask strike fear in your heart?

<p>Full disclosure: ""The Green Hornet"" has NOT been on my list of films to see in theatres since it was announced a few years back. In fact, if it wasn't for being presented with the opportunity to check out an advance screening in Los Angeles this week, I might never have seen the film at all...</p>
<p>The very idea of Seth Rogen taking a turn as a big-screen comic book hero was laughable when it was announced. The addition of visionary director Michel Gondry certainly lent some intrigue to the project, but early reports about troubles with the film's production, the game-time decision to present it in 3D -- and that nagging Seth Rogen issue has kept me from taking ""The Green Hornet"" too seriously.</p>
<p>It would appear that neither the star, who also served as ""The Green Hornet's"" writer and Executive Producer, nor the director took the project seriously leaving the audience with a movie that doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. Is it a comic book movie? Is it a parody of comic book movies? Is it an homage to the short-lived, campy 1960's television series? The answer seems to be ""D,"" all of the above. The trouble is, ""The Green Hornet"" never rises to the level of what the movie ASPIRES to be.</p>

<p>The new film stays close to the hero's origin story first made famous on radio in the 1930's: Newspaper publisher by day, Britt Reid (Rogen), disguises himself as the masked vigilante ""Green Hornet,"" by night. He is accompanied on his adventures in the underworld by his sidekick, martial arts expert Kato, (Jay Chou) who drives their technologically advanced car: ""The Black Beauty"".</p>
<p>Following the untimely death of Reid's father, newspaper publisher James Reid (Tom Wilkinson), Britt and Kato make their debut as drunken vandals turned accidental crime-stoppers. This not-so-dynamic duo is quickly painted as a new breed of criminal in the Los Angeles media, thanks in part of Reid's influence as the newly installed publisher of the city's Daily Sentinel Newspaper.</p>
<p>Posing as criminals, The Green Hornet and Kato work their way through the Los Angeles underworld, taking out various drug dealers and thugs, ultimately attracting the attention of the city's crime-boss, Chudnofsky (Christoph Waltz). The pair manages to stay one-step ahead of both the police and Chudnofsky's gang aided by Daily Sentinel secretary Lenore Case, (Cameron Diaz) and a fleet of bad-ass super-cars.</p>

<p>The story's seemingly simple premise ends up being unnecessarily complicated thanks to a script that tries too hard to balance being a clever crime story with being a comedy that ends up feeling campy. Forget about plot development: we have montages and car-chases in 3D! Hollywood's latest gimmick falls unbelievably flat in some sequences, reducing many shots to a shaky, blurry mess that is unintentionally, simply bad. And while some of the fight sequences featuring Jay Chou's ""Kato"" are enhanced by the treatment, they are not enough to distract the audience from the fact that the movie is too long, the plot too convoluted and the relationship between Rogen and Kato too forced.</p>
<p><br />As co-writer on the project, Seth Rogen turns in a script with dialogue so perfectly written for Seth Rogen, the notion that he's supposed to be playing a character is lost in his rapid-fire, stream-of-consciousness stoner delivery. Add Jay Chou's sometimes hard to decipher accent and it's Rogen who ends up carrying nearly every scene... badly. By the end, the ""Green Hornet's"" plot becomes so convoluted, that it's up to an elaborately choreographed, effects laden Michel Gondry montage narrated by both Rogen AND his dead father to explain it away. <br /><br />With visual nods to the 1960's series, including an end-credit sequence inexplicably added before the end of the film, as well as musical references to the original radio series ""The Green Hornet"" pays great respect to the source material, but ends up disgracing it by adding this loud, messy mash-up to its nearly 50 year legacy.</p>
<p>According to <a title=""this"" href=""http://www.buzzinefilm.com/interviews/film-interview-seth-rogen-cameron-diaz-green-hornet-01112011"" target=""_blank"">this</a> interview from our friends at <a title=""interview"" href=""http://www.buzzinefilm.com/interviews/film-interview-seth-rogen-cameron-diaz-green-hornet-01112011"" target=""_blank"">Buzzine.com</a>, Rogen and Gondry tried to toe the line between making a comic book movie and making a commentary about comic book movies.

<p>Does the idea of a wisecracking Seth Rogen disguised as an underworld heavyweight in a domino mask strike fear in your heart? If you had high hopes for the big-screen adaptation of ""The Green Hornet"" it should... but not in a good way. It's a hornet's nest of bad ideas... in eye-popping 3D!</p>

<p>Full disclosure: ""The Green Hornet"" has NOT been on my list of films to see in theatres since it was announced a few years back. In fact, if it wasn't for being presented with the opportunity to check out an advance screening in Los Angeles this week, I might never have seen the film at all...</p>
<p>The very idea of Seth Rogen taking a turn as a big-screen comic book hero was laughable when it was announced. The addition of visionary director Michel Gondry certainly lent some intrigue to the project, but early reports about troubles with the film's production, the game-time decision to present it in 3D -- and that nagging Seth Rogen issue has kept me from taking ""The Green Hornet"" too seriously.</p>
<p>It would appear that neither the star, who also served as ""The Green Hornet's"" writer and Executive Producer, nor the director took the project seriously leaving the audience with a movie that doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. Is it a comic book movie? Is it a parody of comic book movies? Is it an homage to the short-lived, campy 1960's television series? The answer seems to be ""D,"" all of the above. The trouble is, ""The Green Hornet"" never rises to the level of what the movie ASPIRES to be.</p>

<p>The new film stays close to the hero's origin story first made famous on radio in the 1930's: Newspaper publisher by day, Britt Reid (Rogen), disguises himself as the masked vigilante ""Green Hornet,"" by night. He is accompanied on his adventures in the underworld by his sidekick, martial arts expert Kato, (Jay Chou) who drives their technologically advanced car: ""The Black Beauty"".</p>
<p>Following the untimely death of Reid's father, newspaper publisher James Reid (Tom Wilkinson), Britt and Kato make their debut as drunken vandals turned accidental crime-stoppers. This not-so-dynamic duo is quickly painted as a new breed of criminal in the Los Angeles media, thanks in part of Reid's influence as the newly installed publisher of the city's Daily Sentinel Newspaper.</p>
<p>Posing as criminals, The Green Hornet and Kato work their way through the Los Angeles underworld, taking out various drug dealers and thugs, ultimately attracting the attention of the city's crime-boss, Chudnofsky (Christoph Waltz). The pair manages to stay one-step ahead of both the police and Chudnofsky's gang aided by Daily Sentinel secretary Lenore Case, (Cameron Diaz) and a fleet of bad-ass super-cars.</p>

<p>The story's seemingly simple premise ends up being unnecessarily complicated thanks to a script that tries too hard to balance being a clever crime story with being a comedy that ends up feeling campy. Forget about plot development: we have montages and car-chases in 3D! Hollywood's latest gimmick falls unbelievably flat in some sequences, reducing many shots to a shaky, blurry mess that is unintentionally, simply bad. And while some of the fight sequences featuring Jay Chou's ""Kato"" are enhanced by the treatment, they are not enough to distract the audience from the fact that the movie is too long, the plot too convoluted and the relationship between Rogen and Kato too forced.</p>
<p><br />As co-writer on the project, Seth Rogen turns in a script with dialogue so perfectly written for Seth Rogen, the notion that he's supposed to be playing a character is lost in his rapid-fire, stream-of-consciousness stoner delivery. Add Jay Chou's sometimes hard to decipher accent and it's Rogen who ends up carrying nearly every scene... badly. By the end, the ""Green Hornet's"" plot becomes so convoluted, that it's up to an elaborately choreographed, effects laden Michel Gondry montage narrated by both Rogen AND his dead father to explain it away. <br /><br />With visual nods to the 1960's series, including an end-credit sequence inexplicably added before the end of the film, as well as musical references to the original radio series ""The Green Hornet"" pays great respect to the source material, but ends up disgracing it by adding this loud, messy mash-up to its nearly 50 year legacy.</p>

Is the movie about ""The Green Hornet,"" is it about ""Kato,"" or is it about the ""Black Beauty?"" Unfortunately, the audience isn't given a clear answer and instead is given a movie that doesn't know what it wants to be and ultimately ends up being bad.</p>

<p>Wow.  It's amazing to see what 19 years of video game development looks  like.  What I kind of dig about Tron: Evolution is the use of the actual  movie actors as VO talent for the video game, and the fact Disney had Daft Punk score the movie and the game is pretty cool.</p>

<p>Ethan Shade was one of the most inept, third-string supervillains on Earth. But now he may be the last supervillain on Earth. During a month long war, the world's superheroes banded together and wiped out the villains with the exception of Shade, who quickly went into hiding, fearing for his life. But he soon realized that no one was looking for him. No one was hunting him. No one seemed to know he even existed, and Shade was more than happy to let that continue.   He planned to take down one last bank, pick up a major score, and then leave the country. But the robbery doesn't quite go as planned, and at the end, Shade had accidentally murdered a popular local superhero, and goes on the run, the target of the world&rsquo;s largest manhunt.</p>

By chance, the two meet and what results is a coming-of-age tale set upon a larger than life superhero backdrop. It's a graphic novel where the super villains, the powers, and the incredible fight scenes are really just the catalyst to tell the much deeper story of two people who couldn't be any more different -- or any more alike.</p>

<p>I watched this documentary on drummer Jose Medeles of ""The Breeders"" and was quite intrigued! It has a visual style unlike other documentaries, and keeps a pace that doesn't lead to boredom. Jose has a very unique style, and makes sounds out of pretty much anything he can get his hands on. He's a truly talented guy, and it comes through without effort on screen.</p>
<p>I am very impressed with the storytelling of director Kiino Villand, who has a long history of published photography in magazines and books worldwide. In ""Meaning and Rhetoric"" he chooses a very creative shotlist to show Jose in action, and the locations he chose to shoot at are also very unique. I've seen some of his music video work as well, and he has a style that reminds me a bit of Michel Gondry, well, that is prior to Gondry's work on ""The Green Hornet.""</p>
<p><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://www.lensactionproductions.com/Lens/Meaning_files/droppedImage.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""125"" /></p>
<p>I asked Kiino what inspired him to do this piece, and this was his response:</p>
<div>""I was inspired by the excellence of Frontline Reports. They make  the most compelling documentaries in my opinion. Of course Meaning &amp;  Rhetoric is about a musician, so it's not as hard hitting as Frontline.  But it was important for me to examine what makes Jose tick and explore  his story thoroughly. One portion of the DVD is strictly his solo  abstract drum performance. So any avid musician or die-hard fan will be  blown away. The most special part about it is  the response I've been getting. Kim Deal, Jose's bandmate in The  Breeders and bass player in The Pixies, came to a screening we had with  her twin sister Kelley and they loved it! Completely floored. That was  cool.""
<p>&nbsp;</p>
This documetary would be a great piece for your library if you are a drummer or musician who likes to learn from others in your field. It is also great for non-musicians who have a fascination with sounds and creativity.

<p>Developed by Bioware and published by Electronic Arts, <em>""Mass Effect 2""</em> is the highly anticipated sequel of the award-winning game ""<em>Mass Effect</em>."" The PS3 version allows players to download an  interactive comic that gives gamers 6 choices to make - which are the  main choices from <em>Mass Effect</em>. It doesn't replace the countless  hours Xbox 360 gamers - as well as PC types - spent on the first game.  The ability to import your <em>""Mass Effect""</em> character into ""<em>Mass Effect 2"" </em>is worth the cost alone. You can play without doing the interactive  comic, but the default character is not amazing, and you won't be as tough as Shepard would be had you imported them  into <em>Mass Effect 2</em>.</p>
<p>The sequel starts right where the original ended, but if you are a PS3 only gamer, than you probably haven't had any experience with it prior to now. You will become Commander Shepard, and can choose  to play with a male or female Commander Shepard. There are six classes, which include Soldier, Infiltrator,  Vanguard, Sentinel, Adept and Engineer. When you reach  Level 4 in your specialty, you can learn a newer, higher more focused  talent. This game is filled with adventures, and you will have plenty of hours ahead of you when you decide to take on this game.</p>

<p>If you haven't played it on Xbox, and want a challenge with awesome graphics and endless missions, this game is for you. Mass Effect 2 is a huge install at 22GB, so make sure you plan to do something else once you load the disc. See the video below for some game play previews!</p>

I personally have a hard time questioning Christopher Nolan's casting decisions, so I'm not ready to jump on it yet as bad casting, but I can't say I've ever been a fan of Anne Hathaway's work. When Nolan announced the Heath Ledger choice, I wasn't a hater; I had liked him in about everything he did, same with Christian Bale. <span id=""intelliTXT"">Hathaway won the role of the future Catwoman over a impressive list of actresses that included: Rachel Weisz, Naomi Watts, Blake Lively, Natalie Portman and Keira Knightley.</span></p>
<p><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://flashinglives.com/vidz/catwoman.jpg"" alt="""" width=""587"" height=""216"" /></p>
<p>I'm going to hold my tongue on the Hathaway choice for now, perhaps she will find a new fan in me once this film comes out and I see her performance, so instead of bashing on miss Hathaway, let's take a journey through previous Catwoman actresses.</p>
<p>My Favorite Catwoman was Michelle Pfeiffer in 1992's ""Batman Returns."" I can't imagine anyone topping her performance, or her costume! Check her out in this clip:</p>
<p>
<object width=""425"" height=""344"">
<param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/v/6N5ElA5lqzk?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999"" />

</object>
</p>
<p>It's no question that Pfeiffer was amazing, but on the other end of the spectrum was Halle Berry's horrible performance in 2004's ""Catwoman"" directed by Pitof! I don't know why any studio would ask a guy name Pitof to direct a movie in the first place, and then for that movie to be ""Catwoman"" makes it even more of a questionable decision. I can't hate on the casting of Halle Berry, she's definitely got the pedigree to be Catwoman, but the way it was all done just ended up being a disaster, and Catwoman had seen the end of her nine lives because of that film, see here:</p>

<p>It was pretty difficult to find any ""clips"" of the film ""Catwoman"" on YouTube, I think that is telling enough. Moving on. I loved the 1960's Batman series, and Catwoman was always amazing in it regardless of the actress who portrayed her. Julie Newmar was the original Catwoman, followed by Lee Meriwether, and then Eartha Kitt. Here is Julie Newmar:</p>

<p>Let's hope that Anne Hathaway joins the group of awesome Catwomen, and for all of you guys who had wished for Megan Fox to be cast as Catwoman, I am sorry, but you will always have this piece of art:</p>
<p><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://www.reelcomix.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/megan-fox-catwoman.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""421"" /></p>","<p>Pop Film: Catwoman Rises<br />by <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/andydugan"" target=""_blank"">Andy Dugan</a><br /><br />Warner Bros has announced that Anne Hathaway was cast as Catwoman in the upcoming Batman sequel ""The Dark Knight Rises."" I personally have a hard time questioning Christopher Nolan's casting decisions, so I'm not ready to jump on it yet as bad casting, but I can't say I've ever been a fan of Anne Hathaway's work. When Nolan announced the Heath Ledger choice, I wasn't a hater; I had liked him in about everything he did, same with Christian Bale. <span id=""intelliTXT"">Hathaway won the role of the future Catwoman over a impressive list of actresses that included: Rachel Weisz, Naomi Watts, Blake Lively, Natalie Portman and Keira Knightley.</span></p>
<p><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://flashinglives.com/vidz/catwoman.jpg"" alt="""" width=""587"" height=""216"" /></p>
<p>I'm going to hold my tongue on the Hathaway choice for now, perhaps she will find a new fan in me once this film comes out and I see her performance, so instead of bashing on miss Hathaway, let's take a journey through previous Catwoman actresses.</p>
<p>My Favorite Catwoman was Michelle Pfeiffer in 1992's ""Batman Returns."" I can't imagine anyone topping her performance, or her costume! Check her out in this clip:</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>It's no question that Pfeiffer was amazing, but on the other end of the spectrum was Halle Berry's horrible performance in 2004's ""Catwoman"" directed by Pitof! I don't know why any studio would ask a guy name Pitof to direct a movie in the first place, and then for that movie to be ""Catwoman"" makes it even more of a questionable decision. I can't hate on the casting of Halle Berry, she's definitely got the pedigree to be Catwoman, but the way it was all done just ended up being a disaster, and Catwoman had seen the end of her nine lives because of that film, see here:</p>

</p>
<p>It was pretty difficult to find any ""clips"" of the film ""Catwoman"" on YouTube, I think that is telling enough. Moving on. I loved the 1960's Batman series, and Catwoman was always amazing in it regardless of the actress who portrayed her. Julie Newmar was the original Catwoman, followed by Lee Meriwether, and then Eartha Kitt. Here is Julie Newmar:</p>

</p>
<p>...and this is how Lee Meriwether portrayed Catwoman:</p>

<p>...and of course, the fantastic Eartha Kitt!</p>

<p>So this wouldn't be a complete without another amazing Catwoman! None other than the one from ""Batman: The Animated Series.""</p>

<p>We got an early shot of the X-Men: First Class cast, that was not approved by director Matthew Vaughn; Warner Bros announced that Anne Hathaway was cast as Catwoman in the upcoming ""Dark Knight Rises,"" as well as Tom Hardy as Bane; and Matthew Vaughn then released new photos from X-Men: First Class! Check out three of them below:</p>
<p><img src=""http://blog.newsarama.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/FirstClassMagneto-1024x682.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""386"" /><br />Michael Fassbender as ""Magneto""</p>
<p><img src=""http://blog.newsarama.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/FirstClassXavier-1024x682.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""386"" /><br />James McAvoy as ""Professor X""<br /><br /><img src=""http://blog.newsarama.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/FirstClassStill21.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""380"" /><br />Kevin Bacon as ""Sebastian Shaw"" and January Jones as ""Emma Frost""</p>
<p>I am not really sure that the three photos above really make up for the botched cast photo, but ""thanks"" for the new shots Matthew Vaughn, we really were wondering what James McAvoy looks like! However, anytime January Jones is in any photo, I'll take it.</p>
<p>Moving on... I'm more curious about the story of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" now than anything else related to the film. If you are going to have Catwoman and Bane in the same story, does that mean Bruce Wayne gets a new love interest in Selina Kyle, and then Batman has his back broken at the end of the film to finish off Nolan's trilogy? I'm not sure that would make for a happy ending, but maybe Nolan doesn't want to give us one. Too bad Joel Schumacher didn't follow the Bane storyline in 1997's ""Batman &amp; Robin"" because that Batman was worth destroying.</p>
<p><img src=""http://scrimbrown.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/bane.jpg"" alt="""" width=""439"" height=""529"" /></p>
<p>The Tom Hardy choice for Bane should pan out pretty good, I'm guessing he's going to work out a lot over the next few months and put on some pounds, because he doesn't appear to be that big of a guy, but I'm sure he can pull it off. I am much more excited to see that performance than Anne Hathaway as Catwoman, but I won't get into that <a title=""Catwoman"" href=""../../../../blog/2011/jan/19/pop-film-catwoman-rises/"" target=""_blank"">again</a>.</p>
<p>If you do end up wanting to see a film at the theatres this weekend, you choices are pretty limited. Paramount Pictures is releasing the sex-comedy ""No Strings Attached"" starring Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman; and New Market Films is pushing out ""The Way Back"" starring Ed Harris and Colin Farrell. The trailers are below, but I can't endorse either film.</p>

<p>One thing I will definitely miss from last season is the lead actor, Andy Whitfield, who is being replaced by Liam McIntyre because of a battle with cancer. It's unfortunate that he had to drop out of the show, but Liam looks like a suitable replacement, and I'm looking forward to seeing what he does with the character. I had pretty much written off Starz original shows before I saw ""Spartacus: Blood and Sand,"" because of ""Gravity"" and ""Party Down,"" but now I'm back on their bandwagon. I've always been a fan of HBO and Showtime series, and I feel like Starz really stepped into the arena with ""Blood and Sand,"" so I hope they keep it up with ""Gods of the Arena.""</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t easy, it could take way too long and it really wasn&rsquo;t  cool to see all your hard work resting on the long-term health of some  magnetically coated plastic tape. But that was the beauty of it; it was a  labor of love. The mixtape was an art and everyone knows good art never  comes easy.</p>
<p>Each one contained a story, a struggle and captured a moment in time.  Each song stood for something; it was there for a reason. The mixtape  had mythical powers, it could: impress a girl, make you look cool, make  you look weird, keep you up at night, and it could even keep you from  going to the bathroom while you waited for that one song you needed to  come on the radio.  Not to mention, naming the thing &ndash; the perfect name,  written with the perfect pen in your imperfect handwriting&hellip;</p>
<p>TDK asked some of today&rsquo;s most influential artists to recount their  experiences with making mixtapes and renowned photographer and director  Jonathan Mannion captured it all on film. The result is the TDK Life on  Record Chronicles film series that pays tribute to the days of cassette  tapes and the anatomy of the mixtape. The exclusive film  series starts with The Strokes, New York&rsquo;s own Nas and indie rock stalwarts The  Walkmen. The Chronicles film series provides a rare look into the lives  of these artists that reveals their love of music through songs and  stories from their pasts.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t easy, it could take way too long and it really wasn&rsquo;t  cool to see all your hard work resting on the long-term health of some  magnetically coated plastic tape. But that was the beauty of it; it was a  labor of love. The mixtape was an art and everyone knows good art never  comes easy.</p>
<p>Each one contained a story, a struggle and captured a moment in time.  Each song stood for something; it was there for a reason. The mixtape  had mythical powers, it could: impress a girl, make you look cool, make  you look weird, keep you up at night, and it could even keep you from  going to the bathroom while you waited for that one song you needed to  come on the radio.  Not to mention, naming the thing &ndash; the perfect name,  written with the perfect pen in your imperfect handwriting&hellip;</p>
<p>TDK asked some of today&rsquo;s most influential artists to recount their  experiences with making mixtapes and renowned photographer and director  Jonathan Mannion captured it all on film. The result is the TDK Life on  Record Chronicles film series that pays tribute to the days of cassette  tapes and the anatomy of the mixtape. The exclusive film  series starts with The Strokes, New York&rsquo;s own Nas and indie rock stalwarts The  Walkmen. The Chronicles film series provides a rare look into the lives  of these artists that reveals their love of music through songs and  stories from their pasts.</p>

<br /><br />As of January 2011, I&rsquo;ve started a job as a web/UX designer for ArenaNet, working on Guild Wars 2 -- a game I&rsquo;ve personally been excited about for a long time. If you&rsquo;ve ever dreamed of getting into the industry and imagined how much fun it would be all the time, it&rsquo;s exactly like you picture it... but better. All our meetings are about game mechanics and interactivity. They pay people for this?! (By the way -- I know we&rsquo;re buddies and all, but I am not going to tell you when Guild Wars 2 is coming out.)<br /><br />The genres I end up playing the most are action/adventure, RPG, platformer, and puzzle games. Favorite games include but are not limited to: Red Dead Redemption, Assassin&rsquo;s Creed 2 and Brotherhood, Mass Effect 1 and 2, Braid, and Psychonauts. I don&rsquo;t play pure shooters, mostly because the things that I&rsquo;m bad at make me angry. <br /><br />I&rsquo;m crazy excited to be joining the Pop Galaxy team as we launch the site.

<p>SheGeek Show</p>
<p>Last week, fans of Guild Wars 2 got a surprise when PC Gamer hinted at this week's much-anticipated reveal: the <a href=""http://www.guildwars2.com/en/the-game/professions/guardian/"">Guardian profession</a>.</p>
<p><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://vgrevolution.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/GW2-Guardian-640x250.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""322"" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As with the other professions in Guild Wars 2, the Guardian is designed to take on multiple roles in battle scenarios. A Guardian's virtues -- Justice, Courage, and Resolve -- allow him the variety of attack power and tenacity to deal and take damage, and his special skills include buffs and area-of-effect abilities to support his fellows in combat.</p>

</p>
<p>The Guardian may be heavily armored and have a diversity of weapon combinations, but don't confuse him with the Warrior. It sounds like the Guardian's greatest role will be that of support; although each profession can switch their strength on the fly to adapt to anything the battle throws their way, I see the Guardian's abilities and buffs as being an essential part of any group.  Personally, I love classes that give group buffs and provide distraction from the glass cannon types, because usually I'm playing the glass cannon. The fact that the Guardian can both buff and protect his groupmates makes him a character everyone is going to want on their side.</p>

Well, obviously you get a remake of an old Charles Bronson film with Jason Statham and Ben Foster, a lot of guns, and a film titled ""The Mechanic.""</p>
<p>Personally, I'm kind of tired of remakes. Have Hollywood studios and writers really forgotten how to create new content? It seems like every week a new remake is coming out, regardless of genre.

<p>I always know what I'm getting when I see a Jason Statham film, but this time I'm also seeing a Ben Foster film. Ben Foster is an awesome actor, so I think he gives this film some legitimacy. The truth is, overall, this movie has a great cast, including: Mini Anden, Donald Sutherland, and Tony Goldwyn. It's also directed by Simon West, who has a pretty great resume with action movies (I liked Con Air &amp; The General's Daughter).</p>
<p>I haven't been able to watch ""The Mechanic"" yet, but I plan to this week. Here is another great clip:</p>

<p><strong>SUPERMAN: A CONTEXT OF SEVENTY YEARS OF CASTING</strong> <br />by <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/jasonbadower"" target=""_blank"">Jason Badower</a></p>
<p>The Brit, Henry Cavill has been cast as Superman in the new film. It's directed by Zach Snyder (Watchmen, 300) and produced by Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight, Inception). Superman is such an iconic, cultural figure. He's been flying around since 1938 and has been in some sort of mass media syndication ever since. To make an informed decision as to how we feel about Cavill's casting and what our expectations are, it's necessary to evaluate what has gone before. What were the significant Superman performances and how have they shaped our perception of the Last Son of Krypton over the last seven decades?</p>

He played Superman for eleven years until 1951. This is where they actually invented the concept of Kryptonite. Whenever Buddy fell ill or his voice was sidelined, out came the Kryptonite. Buddy was then able to moan and whimper his way through his performances and it was on with the show. Coincidentally both his condition and the kryptonite scenarios were defeated at the same time.</p>

<p>Looking at this photo it&rsquo;s hard to wonder why this apparent lackluster production failed. Apparently it was broadcast to &ldquo;poor critical reception&rdquo; and failed to capture the energy of the original Broadway show.

<p>Christopher Reeve is Superman. He was trained by Darth Vader (David Prowse) for two months and put on 30 lbs. (14kg) of muscle for the role. He contrasted that physique with a softer, emotional, three-dimensional character.  But it would be easy to overestimate Christopher Reeve&rsquo;s (no relation to George Reeves) performance as the Last Son of Krypton when you compare it to his co-stars. His incredibly grounded and real character was a bright spot of wonder in a cast of scenery-chewing cartoons. It&rsquo;s his stunning portrayal of Superman playing Clark Kent, however, that makes you realize exactly what a secret identity is. The only question is why an almost omnipotent being would choose to bumble his way through life. Is this how he sees us? Or is this how he really wants to be perceived?  In 1995, Reeve suffered a cervical spinal injury that paralyzed him from the waist down. This was just the first of many health complications that Reeve fought. He bested many conditions that should have killed him. In 2004 he went into cardiac arrest and died at the age of 52. His wife Dana went on to start the Christopher &amp; Dana Reeve Foundation to cure spinal cord injury. Grab a sweet set of Superman dog tags and donate to the cause:</p>

<p><strong>JOHN HAYMES NEWTON, SUPERBOY (1988)</strong></p>
<p><img src=""http://superman.marianobayona.com/jhncoss.jpg"" alt="""" width=""499"" height=""800"" /></p>
<p>The Salkinds, the producers of increasingly mediocre Superman movies, decided to look to a different medium to explore the Superman franchise. For his 50th&nbsp;celebration, Superboy was born to television. This happened despite the fact that John Byrne had retconned Superman a year earlier in the comics and smartly eliminated the concept of Superboy. But fanboy rage aside, John Newton only wore the cape for a single season. A combination of a dissatisfactory performance, his requests for a 20% salary raise and a very public DUI arrest all combined to get his ass shipped off to the Phantom Zone.&nbsp; But was continuity restored? Were the universes merged into one coherent whole? Did television and comics finally get along? No indeed. A new Kryptonian was shipped in&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>GERARD CHRISTOPHER, SUPERBOY (1989-1992)</strong></p>
<p><img src=""http://s3.hubimg.com/u/761494_f520.jpg"" alt="""" width=""520"" height=""814"" /></p>
<p>Gerard Christopher took over for Newton. Being the prepubescent teenager that I was, I barely noticed his departure. My teenage hormones were firmly fixed on Stacy Haiduk as Lana Lang. But Gerard went on to both produce and write on the show. Eventually WB put a lien on the show as they&rsquo;d only loaned the Salkinds the rights to the Superman franchise. It was said that they had &ldquo;Lois &amp; Clark&rdquo; in the wings and didn&rsquo;t want two Superman shows on the air. So much for &ldquo;more is better&rdquo;.  Anyway, after he was axed Gerard actually tried out for the role of Superman in &ldquo;Lois &amp; Clark&rdquo; and reportedly won the role. After it was discovered that he had already had a room in the Fortress of Solitude, he was kicked to the curb in favor of Dean Cain&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>DEAN CAIN, LOIS &amp; CLARK: THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN (1993)</strong></p>
<p><img src=""http://cccsupermanfans.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/001.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""711"" /></p>
<p>The title is &ldquo;Lois and Clark&rdquo;, so Clark is the star rather than Superman. It followed John Byrne&rsquo;s theory that Clark Kent is the real personality and Superman is the disguise. This take lends an authenticity to the character, but Dean Cain&rsquo;s almost identical portrayal of both characters brought into question the intelligence and perceptive skills of the reporters of the Daily Planet. The real hallmark of the series, however, was the addition of a Lois Lane (Teri Hatcher) that you could fall in love with (thus empathizing with Superman&rsquo;s feelings), as well as a Lex Luthor played by John Shea that was, for the first time, believable, real and scary.</p>
<p><strong>FRANK KASY (ALEX ROSS), KINGDOM COME (1996)</strong></p>
<p><strong><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://quantifyonline.com/pop/frankkasy.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""380"" /><br /></strong></p>
<p>Who? What? Here&rsquo;s where I sneak one in. Check the heading. &ldquo;significant Superman performances&rdquo;, right? So give a comic book fan his due here. Alex Ross&rsquo; vision of an older, more majestic and statesman-like Superman has had far-reaching cultural influence. His basis for Big Blue is his muse and friend, Frank Kasy. Looking at the above photo reference, it&rsquo;s hard to see The Last Son of Krypton in Kasy&rsquo;s features, but Alex Ross obviously does. Model and artist combine to create a performance greater than the sum of their parts. The seminal graphic novel &ldquo;Kingdom Come&rdquo; embodies this, with &ldquo;Superman: Peace on Earth&rdquo; not far behind.</p>
<p><strong>TOM WELLING SMALLVILLE (2001)</strong></p>
<p><img src=""http://ipadfiends.com/wallpaper/download/36-smallville.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""580"" /></p>
<p>In this incredibly clever revision of the Superman mythos, it&rsquo;s all about discovering the tights. The show has its ups and downs, and it&rsquo;s not particularly well written in places, but it also has a host of fantastic common sense ideas and additions to the mythos. Tom Welling&rsquo;s restrained and quiet, introspective Clark makes for a great platform for the other actors to work from. Michael Rosenbaum&rsquo;s brilliant exploration of the descent of Lex Luthor took John Shea&rsquo;s performance to another level.</p>
<p><strong>MIKE O&rsquo;HEARN, WORLD&rsquo;S FINEST (2004)</strong></p>
<p>Sure it&rsquo;s a fan film trailer, but Sandy Collera can create some nice visuals. And professional body builder (and ex-American Gladiator) Mike O&rsquo;Hearn brings some serious mass to the big blue tights. You should also find Sandy Collera&rsquo;s Batman: Dead End, which is great until he jumps the sharks. Yes. Multiple sharks.</p>

<p><img src=""http://nonsensefilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Brandon.Routh.Superman.Retu_.jpg"" alt="""" width=""320"" height=""451"" /><br />Bryan Singer&rsquo;s exploration of Superman-as-Christ was a film without an audience. The violence was too heavy for children (being shot in the eye was cool though), and the dialog and relationships too simplistic for adults. But Brandon Routh channeled Christopher Reeve beautifully. He brought an alien presence together with the boy-scout charm to create a magnificent performance. In keeping with its preceding films, the only thing worth watching is Superman himself.  Brandon Routh brought a fantastic viewpoint to the Superman curse. Bryan Singer asked Brandon Routh, ""Aren't you worried about the Superman curse? What if something bad happens to you?"" Brandon replied, ""Something bad could happen to me and I might not get to be Superman.""</p>

<p><img src=""http://www.moviehole.net/wp-content/uploads/afflecksuperman.jpg"" alt="""" width=""460"" height=""194"" /></p>
<p>Is it fair to include an actor playing an actor, playing Superman? Sure. Because there are some times where he actually IS Superman. This haunting speculative film suffers from some pacing and gravitas issues on the part of Adrien Brody&rsquo;s character, but is a definite watch for Superman fans.</p>
<p><strong>DWAYNE JOHNSON, SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE (2009)</strong></p>
<p>And the most recent portrayal goes to Dwayne &ldquo;The Rock&rdquo; Johnson. I could watch The Rock in anything, so seeing him in a Superman suit stuffed into a three-piece suit was just gold. Enjoy and laugh. See it here: <a href=""http://www.evanmcb.com/2008/04/saturday-sketch-rock-as-superman.html"" target=""_blank"">http://www.evanmcb.com/2008/04/saturday-sketch-rock-as-superman.html</a></p>
<p><strong>HENRY CAVILL</strong></p>

<p>So how does Henry Cavill stack up against all these seminal actors? To accurately assess that, we need to evaluate him in the context of the script. Hardcore Iron Man fans were concerned that the witty and flippant Robert Downey Jr. would never be able to convey the businessman-like shark ruthlessness of Stark Enterprise&rsquo;s CEO. And he didn&rsquo;t have to. In a clever piece of writing and casting, those personality traits became embodied in Obadiah Stane&rsquo;s (Jeff Bridges) character. So if we&rsquo;re looking for a younger, more ideal Superman who perhaps hasn&rsquo;t come to terms with his role, identity, or powers, the 27-year-old Henry Cavill might just be the perfect casting.</p>
<p>With Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s depth and intelligence, David Goyer&rsquo;s experience with the genre, and Zach Snyder&rsquo;s extraordinary visuals, we might just finally get ourselves a Superman film that works on all fronts.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just hope he punches someone.</p>

<p><strong>SUPERMAN: A CONTEXT OF SEVENTY YEARS OF CASTING</strong> <br />by <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/jasonbadower"" target=""_blank"">Jason Badower</a></p>
<p>The Brit, Henry Cavill has been cast as Superman in the new film. It's directed by Zach Snyder (Watchmen, 300) and produced by Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight, Inception). Superman is such an iconic, cultural figure. He's been flying around since 1938 and has been in some sort of mass media syndication ever since. To make an informed decision as to how we feel about Cavill's casting and what our expectations are, it's necessary to evaluate what has gone before. What were the significant Superman performances and how have they shaped our perception of the Last Son of Krypton over the last seven decades?</p>

<p>This musical has come back from the dead almost as many times as the Man of Tomorrow himself. It&rsquo;s been on and off since the year after it closed all the way through to July of 2010. In fact, it was so popular it even spawned a TV spin-off. If you ask any Broadway musical what it wants to be when it grows up, you will get one answer, &ldquo;anything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>DAVID WILSON, IT&rsquo;S A BIRD&hellip; IT&rsquo;S A PLANE&hellip; IT&rsquo;S SUPERMAN (1975)</strong></p>

<p>Looking at this photo it&rsquo;s hard to wonder why this apparent lackluster production failed. Apparently it was broadcast to &ldquo;poor critical reception&rdquo; and failed to capture the energy of the original Broadway show. I&rsquo;d like to posit that perhaps casting a Superman that knows what the inside of a gym looks like might have helped? David Wilson looks like he&rsquo;d be more at home walking down the aisles of Comic-Con with an oversized bag as big as his sweat stains.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER REEVE, SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE (1978)</strong></p>

<p>Christopher Reeve is Superman. He was trained by Darth Vader (David Prowse) for two months and put on 30 lbs. (14kg) of muscle for the role. He contrasted that physique with a softer, emotional, three-dimensional character.  But it would be easy to overestimate Christopher Reeve&rsquo;s (no relation to George Reeves) performance as the Last Son of Krypton when you compare it to his co-stars. His incredibly grounded and real character was a bright spot of wonder in a cast of scenery-chewing cartoons. It&rsquo;s his stunning portrayal of Superman playing Clark Kent, however, that makes you realize exactly what a secret identity is. The only question is why an almost omnipotent being would choose to bumble his way through life. Is this how he sees us? Or is this how he really wants to be perceived?  In 1995, Reeve suffered a cervical spinal injury that paralyzed him from the waist down. This was just the first of many health complications that Reeve fought. He bested many conditions that should have killed him. In 2004 he went into cardiac arrest and died at the age of 52. His wife Dana went on to start the Christopher &amp; Dana Reeve Foundation to cure spinal cord injury. Grab a sweet set of Superman dog tags and donate to the cause:</p>

</p>
<p>Bill Murray as Superman and Dan Aykroyd as The Flash. I think the proton packs came later. And yes, that&rsquo;s Margot Kidder who played Lois Lane in the Superman movies. Watch and laugh. And then admire all the hair everyone had back then.</p>
<p><strong>JOHN HAYMES NEWTON, SUPERBOY (1988)</strong></p>
<p><img src=""http://superman.marianobayona.com/jhncoss.jpg"" alt="""" width=""499"" height=""800"" /></p>
<p>The Salkinds, the producers of increasingly mediocre Superman movies, decided to look to a different medium to explore the Superman franchise. For his 50th&nbsp;celebration, Superboy was born to television. This happened despite the fact that John Byrne had retconned Superman a year earlier in the comics and smartly eliminated the concept of Superboy. But fanboy rage aside, John Newton only wore the cape for a single season. A combination of a dissatisfactory performance, his requests for a 20% salary raise and a very public DUI arrest all combined to get his ass shipped off to the Phantom Zone.&nbsp; But was continuity restored? Were the universes merged into one coherent whole? Did television and comics finally get along? No indeed. A new Kryptonian was shipped in&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>GERARD CHRISTOPHER, SUPERBOY (1989-1992)</strong></p>
<p><img src=""http://s3.hubimg.com/u/761494_f520.jpg"" alt="""" width=""520"" height=""814"" /></p>
<p>Gerard Christopher took over for Newton. Being the prepubescent teenager that I was, I barely noticed his departure. My teenage hormones were firmly fixed on Stacy Haiduk as Lana Lang. But Gerard went on to both produce and write on the show. Eventually WB put a lien on the show as they&rsquo;d only loaned the Salkinds the rights to the Superman franchise. It was said that they had &ldquo;Lois &amp; Clark&rdquo; in the wings and didn&rsquo;t want two Superman shows on the air. So much for &ldquo;more is better&rdquo;.  Anyway, after he was axed Gerard actually tried out for the role of Superman in &ldquo;Lois &amp; Clark&rdquo; and reportedly won the role. After it was discovered that he had already had a room in the Fortress of Solitude, he was kicked to the curb in favor of Dean Cain&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>DEAN CAIN, LOIS &amp; CLARK: THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN (1993)</strong></p>
<p><img src=""http://cccsupermanfans.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/001.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""711"" /></p>
<p>The title is &ldquo;Lois and Clark&rdquo;, so Clark is the star rather than Superman. It followed John Byrne&rsquo;s theory that Clark Kent is the real personality and Superman is the disguise. This take lends an authenticity to the character, but Dean Cain&rsquo;s almost identical portrayal of both characters brought into question the intelligence and perceptive skills of the reporters of the Daily Planet. The real hallmark of the series, however, was the addition of a Lois Lane (Teri Hatcher) that you could fall in love with (thus empathizing with Superman&rsquo;s feelings), as well as a Lex Luthor played by John Shea that was, for the first time, believable, real and scary.</p>
<p><strong>FRANK KASY (ALEX ROSS), KINGDOM COME (1996)</strong></p>
<p><strong><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://quantifyonline.com/pop/frankkasy.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""380"" /><br /></strong></p>
<p>Who? What? Here&rsquo;s where I sneak one in. Check the heading. &ldquo;significant Superman performances&rdquo;, right? So give a comic book fan his due here. Alex Ross&rsquo; vision of an older, more majestic and statesman-like Superman has had far-reaching cultural influence. His basis for Big Blue is his muse and friend, Frank Kasy. Looking at the above photo reference, it&rsquo;s hard to see The Last Son of Krypton in Kasy&rsquo;s features, but Alex Ross obviously does. Model and artist combine to create a performance greater than the sum of their parts. The seminal graphic novel &ldquo;Kingdom Come&rdquo; embodies this, with &ldquo;Superman: Peace on Earth&rdquo; not far behind.</p>
<p><strong>TOM WELLING SMALLVILLE (2001)</strong></p>
<p><img src=""http://ipadfiends.com/wallpaper/download/36-smallville.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""580"" /></p>
<p>In this incredibly clever revision of the Superman mythos, it&rsquo;s all about discovering the tights. The show has its ups and downs, and it&rsquo;s not particularly well written in places, but it also has a host of fantastic common sense ideas and additions to the mythos. Tom Welling&rsquo;s restrained and quiet, introspective Clark makes for a great platform for the other actors to work from. Michael Rosenbaum&rsquo;s brilliant exploration of the descent of Lex Luthor took John Shea&rsquo;s performance to another level.</p>
<p><strong>MIKE O&rsquo;HEARN, WORLD&rsquo;S FINEST (2004)</strong></p>
<p>Sure it&rsquo;s a fan film trailer, but Sandy Collera can create some nice visuals. And professional body builder (and ex-American Gladiator) Mike O&rsquo;Hearn brings some serious mass to the big blue tights. You should also find Sandy Collera&rsquo;s Batman: Dead End, which is great until he jumps the sharks. Yes. Multiple sharks.</p>

<p><strong>BRANDON ROUTH, SUPERMAN RETURNS (2006)</strong></p>
<p><img src=""http://nonsensefilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Brandon.Routh.Superman.Retu_.jpg"" alt="""" width=""320"" height=""451"" /><br />Bryan Singer&rsquo;s exploration of Superman-as-Christ was a film without an audience. The violence was too heavy for children (being shot in the eye was cool though), and the dialog and relationships too simplistic for adults. But Brandon Routh channeled Christopher Reeve beautifully. He brought an alien presence together with the boy-scout charm to create a magnificent performance. In keeping with its preceding films, the only thing worth watching is Superman himself.  Brandon Routh brought a fantastic viewpoint to the Superman curse. Bryan Singer asked Brandon Routh, ""Aren't you worried about the Superman curse? What if something bad happens to you?"" Brandon replied, ""Something bad could happen to me and I might not get to be Superman.""</p>
<p><strong>BEN AFFLECK, HOLLYWOODLAND (2006)</strong></p>
<p><img src=""http://www.moviehole.net/wp-content/uploads/afflecksuperman.jpg"" alt="""" width=""460"" height=""194"" /></p>
<p>Is it fair to include an actor playing an actor, playing Superman? Sure. Because there are some times where he actually IS Superman. This haunting speculative film suffers from some pacing and gravitas issues on the part of Adrien Brody&rsquo;s character, but is a definite watch for Superman fans.</p>
<p><strong>DWAYNE JOHNSON, SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE (2009)</strong></p>
<p>And the most recent portrayal goes to Dwayne &ldquo;The Rock&rdquo; Johnson. I could watch The Rock in anything, so seeing him in a Superman suit stuffed into a three-piece suit was just gold. Enjoy and laugh. See it here: <a href=""http://www.evanmcb.com/2008/04/saturday-sketch-rock-as-superman.html"" target=""_blank"">http://www.evanmcb.com/2008/04/saturday-sketch-rock-as-superman.html</a></p>
<p><strong>HENRY CAVILL</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_96z6u_KtczM/TUay-oZSrcI/AAAAAAAADAE/PD5mTXsMHS4/s1600/superman-henry-cavill.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""384"" /><br /></strong></p>
<p>So how does Henry Cavill stack up against all these seminal actors? To accurately assess that, we need to evaluate him in the context of the script. Hardcore Iron Man fans were concerned that the witty and flippant Robert Downey Jr. would never be able to convey the businessman-like shark ruthlessness of Stark Enterprise&rsquo;s CEO. And he didn&rsquo;t have to. In a clever piece of writing and casting, those personality traits became embodied in Obadiah Stane&rsquo;s (Jeff Bridges) character. So if we&rsquo;re looking for a younger, more ideal Superman who perhaps hasn&rsquo;t come to terms with his role, identity, or powers, the 27-year-old Henry Cavill might just be the perfect casting.</p>
<p>With Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s depth and intelligence, David Goyer&rsquo;s experience with the genre, and Zach Snyder&rsquo;s extraordinary visuals, we might just finally get ourselves a Superman film that works on all fronts.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just hope he punches someone.</p>

<p>I remember Bulletstorm's first public demo last year. My reaction was: ""Are they serious right now?""

<br />The story starts out pretty standard -- space pirates crash-land on a post-apocalyptic Earth, killer mutants are everywhere, gotta kill your way out. &nbsp;However, it's not story that's going to keep you playing Bulletstorm. I get the feeling it's a little light on story.</p>
<p><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/30/1358225-bulletstorm_screen_8_super.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""317"" /><br /><br />You'll keep playing Bulletstorm because of the lovingly crafted, almost <em>decadent</em> number of ways you will get to create video game carnage. <br /><br />In the tutorial intro, which outlines what each of the buttons do before you actually jump into the game itself, the narrator challenges you to kill mutants as creatively as possible to earn bonuses. He also teaches you what button to press to kick enemies in the beanbag. (His words, not mine.) It perfectly sets the tone for the unapologetic killfest that you're about to unleash.</p>
<p>Graphically speaking, the game looks good. Really good. You'd expect this from Epic, the folks who made the Gears of War games: gorgeous guns, luscious environments, great physics. <br /><br /><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://files.g4tv.com/ImageDb3/249166_S/Gamescom-2010-Bulletstorm-Hands-On-Impressions.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""317"" /></p>
<p>And now we come to the killing.<br /><br />You're going to see a lot of the same bonuses if you stick with just shooting your enemies the same way over and over. What pushes Bulletstorm over the line from shockingly juvenile to genuinely creative is their use of environment in the bonus system. Each map looks to be set up with a huge amount of traps, machines, heights, spikes, exposed wires -- pretty much everything your mom warned you to steer clear of. The more you utilize these environments in your murders, the more likely it is that you'll discover a sweet new bonus you haven't seen before. Kick a guy in the groin and send him over a ledge for a Vertigo bonus. Shoot him with the Flail gun (it shoots two grenades connected by a chain as ammo -- naturally) to hook the grenades around his neck for a Grenade Gag bonus.</p>
<p>The list, as they say, goes on.<br /><br />And that's where the appeal lies. This is a shooter, make no mistake, and it's not easy for me to love console shooters; man was not meant to slaughter video game foes with thumb-sticks. &nbsp;What I'm hoping to see when the game is released is a wider variety of clever murder bonuses, more environmental traps, and more potty humor from the pirate gang. Excessive violence has been done before -- Bulletstorm stands apart by making you giggle at poop jokes while you figure out the most creative and violent way to kill your way through the map.</p>

This May you can find out with the release of the BATMAN: ARKHAM CITY comic book miniseries that was announced today by DC Comics!<br />&nbsp;<br />The new miniseries is written by Batman: The Animated Series writer Paul Dini (who also penned both Arkham games) and drawn by Batman: Arkham Asylum and Batman: Arkham City concept artist Carlos D&rsquo;anda. The miniseries picks up one year after the game ended, and the former Arkham Warden, Quincy Sharp, is now the Mayor of Gotham City. As Mayor, he decides to shut down the Asylum and open up a district known as ""Arkham City,"" where the inmates can roam free and do as they please. It kind of sounds like a Batman version of ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckvDo2JHB7o"" target=""_blank"">Escape from New York</a>."" This urban prison is being run by Dr. Hugo Strange, the only man who knows that Bruce Wayne is Batman.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">I am really looking forward to reading this comic miniseries in preparation for the hours I'm destined to spend on my PS3 this year playing <a href=""http://www.batmanarkhamcity.com/us/main.html"" target=""_blank"">Arkham City</a>!</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">BATMAN: ARKHAM CITY will double-ship in its first month, with issues 1 &amp; 2 landing in May. Each issue of the miniseries will be available day-and-date digitally worldwide for $2.99 each. These releases will alternate with 8-page digital-first interludes that will expand on the story included in the miniseries. Written by Dini and drawn by a variety of artists, these digital stories will focus on The Dark Knight&rsquo;s many enemies as they vie for power in this new city within a city. Each eight-page digital-first interlude will be available for .99 cents, releasing in between issues of the miniseries, and will later be included in print in the BATMAN: ARKHAM CITY collected edition.<br /><br /><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://flashinglives.com/rough/ArkhamCity1cover.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""879"" /><br /><br />&ldquo;The digital first stories offer a unique incentive for fans to experience interesting and exciting stories beyond the pages in the printed comic,&rdquo; said Jim Lee, DC Comics Co-Publisher, &ldquo;The additional pages will serve as interludes within the regular issues and won&rsquo;t be necessary to follow the main story of the miniseries. Fans will also be able to read these interludes in print later, when we publish the collected edition.&rdquo;</p>

This May you can find out with the release of the BATMAN: ARKHAM CITY comic book miniseries that was announced today by DC Comics!<br />&nbsp;<br />The new miniseries is written by Batman: The Animated Series writer Paul Dini (who also penned both Arkham games) and drawn by Batman: Arkham Asylum and Batman: Arkham City concept artist Carlos D&rsquo;anda. The miniseries picks up one year after the game ended, and the former Arkham Warden, Quincy Sharp, is now the Mayor of Gotham City. As Mayor, he decides to shut down the Asylum and open up a district known as ""Arkham City,"" where the inmates can roam free and do as they please. It kind of sounds like a Batman version of ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckvDo2JHB7o"" target=""_blank"">Escape from New York</a>."" This urban prison is being run by Dr. Hugo Strange, the only man who knows that Bruce Wayne is Batman.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">I am really looking forward to reading this comic miniseries in preparation for the hours I'm destined to spend on my PS3 this year playing <a href=""http://www.batmanarkhamcity.com/us/main.html"" target=""_blank"">Arkham City</a>!</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">BATMAN: ARKHAM CITY will double-ship in its first month, with issues 1 &amp; 2 landing in May. Each issue of the miniseries will be available day-and-date digitally worldwide for $2.99 each. These releases will alternate with 8-page digital-first interludes that will expand on the story included in the miniseries. Written by Dini and drawn by a variety of artists, these digital stories will focus on The Dark Knight&rsquo;s many enemies as they vie for power in this new city within a city. Each eight-page digital-first interlude will be available for .99 cents, releasing in between issues of the miniseries, and will later be included in print in the BATMAN: ARKHAM CITY collected edition.<br /><br /><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://flashinglives.com/rough/ArkhamCity1cover.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""879"" /><br /><br />&ldquo;The digital first stories offer a unique incentive for fans to experience interesting and exciting stories beyond the pages in the printed comic,&rdquo; said Jim Lee, DC Comics Co-Publisher, &ldquo;The additional pages will serve as interludes within the regular issues and won&rsquo;t be necessary to follow the main story of the miniseries. Fans will also be able to read these interludes in print later, when we publish the collected edition.&rdquo;</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">This week on the latest episode of the <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/shegeekshow"" target=""_blank"">She Geek Show</a> here on Pop Galaxy, Kate talks the game screenshots that were released, and gives us a history in Batman video games. Arkham City is bound to be a hit, and I'm pretty sure the comic miniseries will too.</p>

<p>Marvel and Hasbro have released images of the forthcoming Captain  America toys, and they look a lot like repainted G.I. Joe figures. I remember back in 94' when Hasbro made ""Street Fighter II"" toys, which also ended up being repainted ""Duke"" and ""Storm Shadow"" figurines. I hope kids today aren't as disappointed as I was when I was left with another ""Flint"" toy disguised as ""Guile."" Take a look at these new G.I. Joes, I mean Captain America toys!</p>

<p>So feel free to let us know your thoughts on these bad boys... I personally think the ""Zartan"" character above goes one step too far.

<p>Marvel and Hasbro have released images of the forthcoming Captain  America toys, and they look a lot like repainted G.I. Joe figures. I remember back in 94' when Hasbro made ""Street Fighter II"" toys, which also ended up being repainted ""Duke"" and ""Storm Shadow"" figurines. I hope kids today aren't as disappointed as I was when I was left with another ""Flint"" toy disguised as ""Guile."" Take a look at these new G.I. Joes, I mean Captain America toys!</p>

<p>Stacking is another downloadable morsel, available for both Xbox Live Arcade and PSN (for 1200 MS Points or $14.99, respectively -- free if you're a Playstation Plus member!). Stacking is set in the industrial start of the 20th century, right at that moment where the future could have deviated toward steampunk rather than electric futurism. Characters are grubby, there are coal mines, there's a level on a zeppelin, and cut scenes are told as silent movies. The soundtrack is excellent, comprised of jaunty piano music taking its influence from dramatic silent film scores. It definitely nails down the feeling of an era.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You are Charlie Blackmore, the smallest member of a family of Russian stacking dolls (or ""matryoshka"", in case you like cool Russian words). Your siblings are abducted and forced into child labor across a variety of levels, and naturally, you gotta save 'em. As the smallest stacking doll in Stacking-land, your job is to stack inside other, bigger dolls with various abilities that allow you to solve puzzles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dolls vary widely in ability. There are a set of basic dolls you learn to identify on sight -- the little paperboys with the ""throw paper"" ability, the lady doll who sips tea on command, the larger man with the noxious belch. There's also a couple dozen special dolls per level whose abilities are unique; find and stack with every unique doll in each level to complete your collection. It's more than a little addictive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's up to you and Charlie Blackmore to try out each doll type you see, get a feel for its abilities, and keep them in mind when you're up against puzzles in the game. Each puzzle has at least three possible ways it can be successfully completed. This is actually my favorite part of the game: once you solve a puzzle, you can move right along to the next part, or you can approach the puzzle again and try to figure out the alternate solutions. Sometimes they're pretty blindingly obvious. Sometimes, not so much. (Hint: you're gonna want to fart into that air vent.)</p>
<p>In addition to solving the puzzles, certain unique dolls have ""Hi-Jinks"" to complete. These are mini-challenges that require you to use the doll's special ability a certain number of times in certain situations. Stack with every unique doll, complete all the Hi-Jinks, and find each solution for every puzzle to get 100% in Stacking. You completionists will have no lack of things to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src=""http://cdni.gamezone.com/images/screenshots/Stacking_4.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""340"" /></p>
<p>All in all, Stacking is tremendous title for those of you who are looking for a little break from your Halos or your Calls of Duty. It's unlike anything out there. So far I've played it for about 4 hours, and I'm still only at about 55% complete; I'd say it gives great bang for the buck. Support Double Fine! Support indie! Champion the proletariat!</p>

<p>Well it&rsquo;s 2011, and there is no denying that the digital content revolution is here to stay and is only going to become stronger. No matter the industry (mostly talking entertainment here), the digital age has transformed how we consume and produce content. &nbsp;<br /> <br /> We&rsquo;ve seen the effects that the digital revolution has had on many industries throughout the years, possibly the most notable being the Film/TV industry. When I was in film school 10+ years ago now, the debate of film vs. video was always a hot topic. You had the die-hard film lovers that would throw down with the video lovers in an all out rumble over who was right. But where are the die-hards today? Most of them are shooting video...or now digital video. <br /> <br /> I know because I was one of those die-hards. I swore I would be the last one to shoot digital, if ever. In film school I championed film and threw down against the video crowd. It&rsquo;s transient. No one will take you seriously. You&rsquo;re not &ldquo;real&rdquo; if you shoot on video. Then technology began to creep up. Riddled with guilt, I bought by first digital Nikon camera. You have to know your enemy, right? With each click my resolve waned. I could now afford to shoot thousands of pictures instead of a couple rolls of negatives. I&rsquo;m sure I made the money back I spent on my camera in the first week from not having to buy stock, process it and then print it. It wasn&rsquo;t too long before the same was true for filmmaking.</p>

</p>
<p>So now like many independent filmmakers I could actually afford to make a movie without having to sell my soul for production costs. Filmmakers could shoot, edit and distribute their creation all on their own. And people could even see it... online! Then digital hit the music industry. Bands can now do everything themselves too.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve now come to the final frontier: the world of publishing comics and books. This debate has been building over the past years and will likely be around for a few more. But this is what I&rsquo;ve learned, and how I&rsquo;ve tried to help digital comics.</p>
<p>I believe publishing companies need to rethink their strategy and stop going broke pushing out books that may or may not sell. I don&rsquo;t think print books will ever fully go away, at least not in my lifetime, but when it comes to mass consumption they will be obsolete. I can see the die-hard paperback readers rolling their eyes. But when was the last time you bought a cd and didn&rsquo;t rip it to your mp3 player? The fact is that digital just makes the entire experience easier, cheaper, immediate and more interactive.</p>
<p>But the creative currency of the digital age is not money, it&rsquo;s knowledge. Do you know how to build and maintain a website for your creation? Probably not. You&rsquo;re too busy creating. So I built a digital publishing platform called WEvolt (<a href=""http://www.wevolt.com"" target=""_blank"">www.wevolt.com</a>). It&rsquo;s code-free, easy to use, and a fully featured platform that allows creators and publishers to hit the ground running. And it was recently bought by WOWIO (<a href=""http://www.wowio.com"" target=""_blank"">www.wowio.com</a>).</p>
<p>But why would I go to all the trouble of building a digital platform? Why would WOWIO see the benefit of owning the platform? Here&rsquo;s a list of fun and serious reasons:</p>
<p>1) Moving! Yeah, the silly one first, I know this shouldn&rsquo;t be number 1, but I just moved again and had to hire an entire team of day laborers to move my book collection to my new place. I&rsquo;m running out of room! And now to find stuff or reference anything, I have to sort through boxes and boxes. There comes a point when this just gets ridiculous unless I have enough money to build a 10 level library with a cool sliding ladder and a butler. Or, I could just hold my entire collection on a portable hard drive. <br /> <br /> 2) Reach a new audience. A lot of people say that by putting their content for sale online they are cannibalizing their sales. People that used to buy their books will now be getting the $.99 pdf instead of buying the book. This simply isn&rsquo;t true, or enough for it to really make a difference. At the moment it&rsquo;s two different audiences. The people that are buying the digital version are not buying the print version. So you are really reaching a whole new group of readers that may have not even heard about your book and will give it a try for a buck. Another approach if you are really worried about this is offer stuff in print you don&rsquo;t get online and vice-versa. Integrate the two so one side feeds the other. <br /> <br /> 3) Costs. Above everything else, going with a digital distribution model first will save Creators/Indy publishers thousands, potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars. Put all that money you would have spent printing towards marketing your book. Gain an audience, and then make prints available for those that want the book. Digital gives you the ability to make sure you have an audience that will even buy your book before you print. Or do test runs of new series and see what kind of reader feedback you get before doing 3 more issues. With the quality of Print on Demand houses out these days, you can still offer prints without shelling out thousands of dollars and appease the need for your print readers. <br /> <br /> 4) Interactivity. This is one of the greatest things about the digital age when it comes to consumption of content. In a print book, other than the foreword by the creator, or attending a convention, there was no way for a reader to interact with the creator, or get inside views like DVD features do for film. There is no forum or comment system in the back of a print book, but in digital, you have the ability to interact directly with the creator. Or taking it a step further, interact with others that love or hate the content as much as you do. By giving readers this option, you are further gaining their readership and a sense of ownership and loyalty to the content. <br /> <br /> 5) Easy and Immediate. Whether you have a tablet, kindle or iPad or just a web browser, it&rsquo;s just easy and fast to get new content. I don&rsquo;t have to sit in traffic driving to the bookstore and then hoping the book is in stock. I just log in, search and download. For the generation that is coming up, this is what they want. They want it now! And the new generation is for the most part being raised on digital content and technology. They would rather have their content served through a screen. Once the new generation becomes the &lsquo;buyers&rsquo;, you&rsquo;d have to pay them to get their content in print and they will become your audience if they aren&rsquo;t already. <br /> <br /> 6) Cinematic. This one I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll get some push back on, but I personally find comics that have been made for the digital experience vs. print have a more cinematic feel. By &lsquo;made for digital&rsquo; I mean the actual pages are half the size of a typical comic and made to fit on your screen or iPad. To me, this format feels much more cinematic and also keeps the reader flowing through pages. Not to mention when it comes to producing an ongoing series, the artist now has to do half the work to hit deadlines. <br /> <br /> Anyway, that&rsquo;s my take on why digital will be the dominating the industry in the coming years. I for one, am very excited about how the industry is changing. The comics business has been led by the big two with one distributor for too long and I think this type of change is exactly what this industry needs. Maybe some creators that couldn&rsquo;t afford it before will now come out of the woodwork and create the next masterpiece without having to rely on Diamond, Marvel, DC or a publishing partner. Maybe it will be you? <br /> <br /> But now with all that said, how do you make money online? &nbsp;Well more revenue models pop up everyday, and we at WOWIO are always striving to find new and inventive ways to answer that question. But... that sounds like a new blog post to me.</p>","<p>Pop Comics: The Digital Age.<br />by <a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/matteblack"" target=""_blank"">Matt Jacobs</a></p>

I don&rsquo;t have to sit in traffic driving to the bookstore and then hoping the book is in stock. I just log in, search and download. For the generation that is coming up, this is what they want. They want it now! And the new generation is for the most part being raised on digital content and technology. They would rather have their content served through a screen. Once the new generation becomes the &lsquo;buyers&rsquo;, you&rsquo;d have to pay them to get their content in print and they will become your audience if they aren&rsquo;t already. <br /> <br /> 6) Cinematic. This one I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll get some push back on, but I personally find comics that have been made for the digital experience vs. print have a more cinematic feel. By &lsquo;made for digital&rsquo; I mean the actual pages are half the size of a typical comic and made to fit on your screen or iPad. To me, this format feels much more cinematic and also keeps the reader flowing through pages. Not to mention when it comes to producing an ongoing series, the artist now has to do half the work to hit deadlines. <br /> <br /> Anyway, that&rsquo;s my take on why digital will be the dominating the industry in the coming years. I for one, am very excited about how the industry is changing. The comics business has been led by the big two with one distributor for too long and I think this type of change is exactly what this industry needs. Maybe some creators that couldn&rsquo;t afford it before will now come out of the woodwork and create the next masterpiece without having to rely on Diamond, Marvel, DC or a publishing partner. Maybe it will be you? <br /> <br /> But now with all that said, how do you make money online? &nbsp;Well more revenue models pop up everyday, and we at WOWIO are always striving to find new and inventive ways to answer that question.

<p>The announcement trailer went up yesterday for the zombie title Dead Island. The trailer is excellent and may have you sniffling a little bit by the end -- feels like a trailer for one of the better zombie movies to come out in the last decade. Dead Island is a survival horror game (naturally) set on a tropical island; beat up the zombies, escape the island. But it's got a few elements we haven't seen before. Combat will mostly be melee; very few stores of guns and ammo exist on a tropical island, after all. Weapons will degrade and eventually break. There's four-player co-op (the seamless drop-in, drop-out kind -- bless you, devs). And there's actually a semblance of compelling RPG to it. Melee combat can get repetitive, no matter how gruesomely rendered the mutilation may be -- but this is one to keep an eye on.</p>

<p>Living in Hollywood, I find that I mean a lot of &ldquo;actors&rdquo; and &ldquo;writers&rdquo; but I also find that I also meet a lot of &ldquo;directors.&rdquo; The truth is, in LA, I&rsquo;d say about 10% of the people I meet who say they are one of those things, are actually talented at it. It&rsquo;s unfortunate, but also just a statistic that will always be, and we all know based on films that have been released, it&rsquo;s not necessarily the talent that makes people successful. Regardless, I&rsquo;m looking for some real &ldquo;directors.&rdquo; Today&rsquo;s technology has changed the game for up and coming directors to show their talent, and I want to collaborate with some of you to create some fun videos for Pop Galaxy.</p>
<p>You really never know what an awesome viral video can do for your directing career, so I&rsquo;m going to give you a few good examples.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/bradwinderbaum"" target=""_blank"">Brad Winderbaum</a>&rsquo;s <a href=""http://www.hulu.com/satacracy88"" target=""_blank"">Satacracy 88</a>. This was an interactive sci-fi web series that I produced in 2005-2008, and went on to win a Webby Award and Emmy Award. The beauty of it was that it eventually excelled Brad to a position at Marvel Studios, and while we still await his first feature, it&rsquo;s definitely coming. He executed a high level of production value, with little to no money, and on the Internet before anyone was doing web series. Look for more from Brad Winderbaum in the future.</p>

<p>Another awesome director is <a href=""http://www.garyshore.com/"" target=""_blank"">Gary Shore</a>. He made a very slick Wolverine fan film using his skills, and he is now directing commercials for Adidas and Kodak. The fan film was on his own dime and his own time, but I can guarantee you the Adidas and Kodak shoots were great paychecks for him.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.rickdarge.com/"" target=""_blank"">Rick Darge</a> has been a Director of Photography for years, shooting a lot of web video content, mostly on his own. He shot Brad Winderbaum&rsquo;s Satacracy 88, and numerous other web series and music videos. He also created and directed his own show, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/itsallinyourhands"" target=""_blank"">Moonshine</a>, which saw a pretty decent amount of online views in 2008 and 2009. As of recent, he&rsquo;s known for directing LCD Soundsystem&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=""http://vimeo.com/15163137"" target=""_blank"">Home</a>&rdquo; music video, which he did on his own, without LCD on board, but it&rsquo;s a creative journey that caught the eye of the band, and has been made the unofficial-official music video for the song. He&rsquo;s now doing commercials for Xbox video games, and Sun Chips.</p>

<p>One of my favorite viral video director stories is &ldquo;<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs3ROFNxa5M"" target=""_self"">Mortal Kombat: Rebirth</a>&rdquo; which was directed by <a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/ktanch"" target=""_blank"">Kevin Tancharoen</a>, who had hoped to use it to lobby Warner Bros. to sign him on to do a reboot <em>MK</em> film, and it worked, he is now behind a fully funded Mortal Kombat web series with Warner Premiere. &ldquo;Rebirth&rdquo; was of his own doing, and we wouldn&rsquo;t be seeing any live action Mortal Kombat movie anytime soon if Kevin Tancharoen didn&rsquo;t create the fan film.</p>

<p>I know I&rsquo;ll get flack from some people, that it&rsquo;s all being done for free, and people should be paid. Yes, I know that, I&rsquo;m also one of those producer/directors who made a lot of stuff with favors and for free, but I wouldn't be where I am today had I not done that. I know you need resources, or need to have your own &ldquo;7D&rdquo; or &ldquo;HVX&rdquo; and Final Cut, and some skills to use all those things, but isn&rsquo;t that the point? Maybe you're not a writer, so collaborate with someone who is. Do you take yourself seriously as a director? If you do, create, make things, and make something for me.</p>
<p>I want to see what you can do for Pop Galaxy. The slogan: This Is Pop! Music : Movies: Comics : TV : Video Games. Does that give you an idea? Can you make me a viral video for Pop Galaxy?

Jesse teamed up with his co-writer Mark Gantt to create a &ldquo;teaser&rdquo; trailer for a film/web series the wanted to make, so they shot a slick trailer and put it out there, a year later Sony released &ldquo;The Bannen Way&rdquo; on Crackle.com, and now you get watch it on TV or buy it on DVD. That&rsquo;s another kick ass story.</p>

<p>I know I&rsquo;ll get flack from some people, that it&rsquo;s all being done for free, and people should be paid. Yes, I know that, I&rsquo;m also one of those producer/directors who made a lot of stuff with favors and for free, but I wouldn't be where I am today had I not done that. I know you need resources, or need to have your own &ldquo;7D&rdquo; or &ldquo;HVX&rdquo; and Final Cut, and some skills to use all those things, but isn&rsquo;t that the point? Maybe you're not a writer, so collaborate with someone who is. Do you take yourself seriously as a director? If you do, create, make things, and make something for me.</p>
<p>I want to see what you can do for Pop Galaxy. The slogan: This Is Pop! Music : Movies: Comics : TV : Video Games. Does that give you an idea? Can you make me a viral video for Pop Galaxy? Something quick, fastpaced, creative? Something that will drive people to want to find out what Pop Galaxy is? Send me your best treatment to <a href=""mailto:adugan@wowio.com"">adugan@wowio.com</a> and I&rsquo;ll pick some that I&rsquo;ll green light for production&hellip; I&rsquo;m not expecting you to do this all for free, but if I like your idea, we&rsquo;ll talk what we can do budgetary wise. Overall, let's just have some fun with it.&nbsp; So, show me what you got, and let&rsquo;s shoot some videos!</p>","<p>Pop Extra: Show Us What You Got<br />By <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/andydugan"" target=""_blank"">Andy Dugan</a></p>","<p>Pop Extra: Show Us What You Got<br />By <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/andydugan"" target=""_blank"">Andy Dugan</a></p>","02/18/2011 09:20:09","mortal kombat rebirth, satacracy 88, lcd soundsystem home, gary shore, brad winderbaum, jesse warren, mark gantt, the bannen way, zippo, rick darge, m. keegan uhl, kevin tancharoen, directors, andy dugan, commercial contest, pop galaxy, 7D, wolverine","1","1","pop-extra-show-us-what-you-got","thumbs/directorthumb.jpg"

<p>It's Music Monday, so I'm gonna give you 5 music videos I think you should check out this week. I picked these purely based on how creative I thought the film maker took the song and put it into video form.</p>
<p>Let's start with Dr. Dre's Kush. This video was directed by Joseph Kahn and had a very large budget, but overall, I think Joseph Kahn did a great job turning this song into a video. Let's be honest, the song is about lighting it up and getting high, so that could go a lot of different directions, however, Kahn stops time, and I like that approach.</p>

<p>Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is the latest installment in a long tradition of pitting Marvel characters against characters of other canons and making them beat each other up. It does this thing very well, and looks very good doing it, bringing back some of the classic characters and adding more into the mix.</p>
<p><img src=""http://playstationlifestyle.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/feature-Marvel-Vs-Capcom-3-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""200"" /></p>
<p>Now, for many years, I have considered myself something of an astonishing genius when it comes to fighting games. Battle Arena: Toshinden was my proving ground. I did the rounds with Street Fighters and Mortal Kombats in arcades, and I think I even got my grabby little hands on Marvel vs. Capcom 2 in the dark time when it was a rarity (now it's available for download on XBL and PSN). My tactic, which is unstoppable against an unwitting opponent, involves nothing resembling skill. Unfortunately, in Marvel vs. Capcom 3, that kind of tomfoolery didn't get me very far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The story (which is rather thin) is spun during the opening cinematic: characters are fighting each other! The art is lovely! Morrigan's very well endowed in the chest area! Then Dormammu shows up and shoots fireballs? And then Galactus is hungry. Therefore, teams of three heroes from the universes of Marvel and Capcom must battle each other. These cinematics may not make a lick of sense, but they do look excellent -- highly detailed models with inked outlines that look like comics come alive.</p>
<p><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ni9L4_zKNrM"" width=""560"" height=""349"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p>Perhaps the strongest part of this game is how lovingly the characters themselves are treated. From a huge variety of disparate art backgrounds, somehow all of these characters take on a united art direction in Marvel vs. Capcom 3. The animation from both the characters and the backgrounds is enough to make you stop and stare (and get your butt handed to you while you're gawking -- not that this happened to me or anything). Not only that, but the Capcom characters' behaviors stay extremely true to their game backgrounds, and the Marvel characters behave they way they do on the page. Don't worry; you'll get all your customary sass and fourth-wall-destruction from Deadpool. And the characters interact with one another depending on who's fighting! You'll get different interactions based on actual canon histories and sexual proclivities. It's a blast to try new matchups just to see how they'll talk to each other.</p>
<p>To me, in a fighting game, the least telling thing about the game is the fighting itself. I've always been under the impression that a blind box turtle could be a fighting game ace as long as he could mash buttons fast enough. However, you've gotta love the fighting in Marvel vs. Capcom 3 -- even if you're terribly unskilled, or if you're just observing from the sidelines. They've done away with the traditional punch/kick button set, opting for light/medium/heavy attacks, two buttons for tagging your teammates, and one special attack button. In addition, there's a crazy new X-Factor element: press all four of the face buttons on your controller to get faster, stronger, heal your character, and negate chip damage (or damage you take while shielding). If all this sounds too complex, there's a new ""Simple"" mode available where combos are just one press of a button and you don't have to memorize button sequences -- but this is not a terribly rewarding mode, and definitely feels like the old folks' home version of the game.</p>
<p>So there's a lot to love.</p>

<p>There's no official tutorial. For people whose barrier to entry into fighting games is high, this can be a deal breaker.

<p>Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is the latest installment in a long tradition of pitting Marvel characters against characters of other canons and making them beat each other up. It does this thing very well, and looks very good doing it, bringing back some of the classic characters and adding more into the mix.</p>
<p><img src=""http://playstationlifestyle.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/feature-Marvel-Vs-Capcom-3-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""200"" /></p>
<p>Now, for many years, I have considered myself something of an astonishing genius when it comes to fighting games. Battle Arena: Toshinden was my proving ground. I did the rounds with Street Fighters and Mortal Kombats in arcades, and I think I even got my grabby little hands on Marvel vs. Capcom 2 in the dark time when it was a rarity (now it's available for download on XBL and PSN). My tactic, which is unstoppable against an unwitting opponent, involves nothing resembling skill. Unfortunately, in Marvel vs. Capcom 3, that kind of tomfoolery didn't get me very far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The story (which is rather thin) is spun during the opening cinematic: characters are fighting each other! The art is lovely! Morrigan's very well endowed in the chest area! Then Dormammu shows up and shoots fireballs? And then Galactus is hungry. Therefore, teams of three heroes from the universes of Marvel and Capcom must battle each other. These cinematics may not make a lick of sense, but they do look excellent -- highly detailed models with inked outlines that look like comics come alive.</p>
<p><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ni9L4_zKNrM"" width=""560"" height=""349"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p>Perhaps the strongest part of this game is how lovingly the characters themselves are treated. From a huge variety of disparate art backgrounds, somehow all of these characters take on a united art direction in Marvel vs. Capcom 3. The animation from both the characters and the backgrounds is enough to make you stop and stare (and get your butt handed to you while you're gawking -- not that this happened to me or anything). Not only that, but the Capcom characters' behaviors stay extremely true to their game backgrounds, and the Marvel characters behave they way they do on the page. Don't worry; you'll get all your customary sass and fourth-wall-destruction from Deadpool. And the characters interact with one another depending on who's fighting! You'll get different interactions based on actual canon histories and sexual proclivities. It's a blast to try new matchups just to see how they'll talk to each other.</p>
<p>To me, in a fighting game, the least telling thing about the game is the fighting itself. I've always been under the impression that a blind box turtle could be a fighting game ace as long as he could mash buttons fast enough. However, you've gotta love the fighting in Marvel vs. Capcom 3 -- even if you're terribly unskilled, or if you're just observing from the sidelines. They've done away with the traditional punch/kick button set, opting for light/medium/heavy attacks, two buttons for tagging your teammates, and one special attack button. In addition, there's a crazy new X-Factor element: press all four of the face buttons on your controller to get faster, stronger, heal your character, and negate chip damage (or damage you take while shielding). If all this sounds too complex, there's a new ""Simple"" mode available where combos are just one press of a button and you don't have to memorize button sequences -- but this is not a terribly rewarding mode, and definitely feels like the old folks' home version of the game.</p>
<p>So there's a lot to love.</p>

<p>Was it <em>Batman Begins</em>, <em>The Dark Knight</em> or the amazing video game, <em>Arkham Asylum</em>?</p>
<p>I'm sure you've always known who Batman was. But I'm guessing it was one of those three that managed to get its bat-grappling hook into you.</p>
<p>And now you're hungry for more.</p>
<p>But where to start? The streets of Gotham City are old and circuitous. Some stories are must-reads and others are forgettable. And there's the sheer quantity. Detective Comics has been going since May of 1930, and the series called Batman has been going since 1940. If you include the current eight ongoing series and countless graphic novels, collections, mini-series, maxi-series, tie-ins and features you'd probably be able to wallpaper all of Gotham in Batman comics.</p>
<p>So I've saved you some trouble.</p>
<p>Here's a list of ten Batman graphic novels that undoubtedly influenced Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale and the late Heath Ledger in <em>Batman Begins</em> and <em>The Dark Knight</em>. It also includes a couple of seminal books by the writer of <em>Batman: Arkham Asylum</em>. Those of you familiar with just the films might be surprised to discover that Batman is also known as ""the world's greatest detective"". It's an aspect of the character that was omitted from the films.</p>
<p>So forearmed with that knowledge, bat-boys and bat-girls, I present to you:</p>

<p><img style=""float: left; margin: 2px;"" src=""http://www.flashinglives.com/popgalaxy/batmanyearone.png"" alt="""" width=""303"" height=""468"" /><strong>1<em>. The origin of the Batman...</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>BATMAN: YEAR ONE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Written by Frank Miller (300, Sin City)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Drawn by David Mazuchelli</strong></p>
<p>Unlike <em>Batman Begins</em>, this seminal graphic novel is more about Batman&rsquo;s return to Gotham after his time training abroad. Paralleling Bruce&rsquo;s journey is the gripping story of Captain Jim Gordon&rsquo;s life as the only honest cop in Gotham. It&rsquo;s dark, smart, very grounded and unanimously on every Bat-fan's utility belt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>NOTE: Selina Kyle (Catwoman) in this story appears black. In proceeding books the higher-ups at DC returned Catwoman to her original ethnicity: Caucasian. One can only surmise that some sort of Michael Jackson-like condition befell Selina.</em></p>

<p><strong>BATMAN: PREY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Written by Doug Moench</strong></p>
<p><strong>Art by Paul Gulacy</strong></p>
<p>Who the hell is Hugo Strange? Originally conceived back in 1940, Professor Hugo Strange was an early re-occurring villain before the debut of the Joker. Once the clown prince of crime entered the scene, Strange was benched. So why should you care about a forgotten villain? Well, he&rsquo;s not only the villain of the upcoming videogame <em>Arkham City</em>, but he&rsquo;s also a rumored villain in <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>. &nbsp;And you know what sets him apart? He&rsquo;s the only villain that knows Batman is Bruce Wayne. PREY is very much like a sequel to <em>Batman: Year One</em>, so I&rsquo;ve included it early on your reading list.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: While the two creators are first class, this book is a product of mainstream 1990s style of storytelling which may cause it to seem a little dated compared to the others on the list. </em></p>

<p><strong>BATMAN: THE KILLING JOKE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Written by Alan Moore (Watchmen, V for Vendetta)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Art by Brian Bolland</strong></p>
<p>What is a hero without his villain? If <em>Batman: Year One</em> was our <em>Batman Begins</em>, then <em>The Killing Joke</em> is our <em>The Dark Knight</em>. It&rsquo;s a very different take than the movie and instead poses an origin to the Joker. Whether it&rsquo;s true or, like the movie, simply one of the Joker&rsquo;s many lies about how he got his scars, is up for debate. But the book&rsquo;s insight into the Joker, Batman, and their relationship is groundbreaking, heartbreaking and rendered uncomfortably real. Of interest, the events in this story were later folded into &ldquo;official&rdquo; Batman continuity and one specific character bears very permanent wounds to this day.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: Brian Bolland's vision of the Joker can still be found plastered all over t-shirts over twenty years later. Bolland hated the coloring and re-colored it himself, but in retrospect, John Higgin's bold palette really added something to the story.</em></p>

<p><strong>BATMAN: HARLEY QUINN</strong></p>
<p><strong>Written by Paul Dini (Arkham Asylum, Batman: The Animated Series)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Drawn by Yvel Guichet and Aaron Sowd</strong></p>
<p>This entry is for those fans of <em>Batman: Arkham Asylum</em> who are eagerly awaiting this year&rsquo;s release of <em>Batman: Arkham City</em>. Who exactly is the Joker&rsquo;s main squeeze? Created just for the animated series, Harley proved herself too popular and made her way into &ldquo;official&rdquo; Batman continuity. Her start in the comics begins here. This is written by the man who would later write <em>Arkham Asylum</em>. You may not physically recognize her on these pages, but just imagine she decided to commandeer a nurse&rsquo;s costume for the video game.</p>

<p><strong>BATMAN: BLACK AND WHITE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Written by Various</strong></p>
<p><strong>Drawn by Various</strong></p>
<p>Back in 1996, DC&rsquo;s art director Mark Chiarello collected an all-star team of some of the greatest comic book artists and writers to do short Batman stories. I include this not so much as a piece of continuity, but rather as the greatest summation of Batman&rsquo;s adventures through popular culture. Art-wise, my favorite is issue four, but it&rsquo;s only a bare nose ahead of the others because of the tremendous talent involved. This collection is pretty much the highlight reel of all of Batman&rsquo;s adventures over the last 80 or so years.</p>

<p><strong><em>6. The quintessential femme fatale anti-hero: Catwoman</em></strong><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>CATWOMAN: THE DARK END OF THE STREET</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Written by Ed Brubaker</strong></p>
<p><strong>Art by Darwyn Cooke</strong></p>
<p>This fantastic team examines the moral ambiguity of a person outside a system of law that's been long broken. The take home points here are to examine the shades of grey as the book examines Selina Kyle's origin and motivations. While the artwork may seem cartoony, the content is very much otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>BATMAN: WAR ON CRIME</strong></p>
<p><strong>Written by Paul Dini</strong></p>
<p><strong>Art by Alex Ross</strong></p>
<p>Another great book written by the writer of <em>Arkham Asylum</em> (maybe you can see why he got the job?). Alex Ross and Paul Dini ground Batman visually and narratively. It&rsquo;s a good story brilliantly illustrated by Alex Ross. This wonderful, oversized book makes you believe a guy could run around in a bat suit.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: Alex Ross is one of the few artists who wouldn't white out the eyes of his heroes, instead employing the cinematic mask and eye paint we know so well. He also gave Batman brown eyes to visually distinguish him more from the blue-eyed Superman.</em></p>

<p><strong><em>8. The effect the Batman has on his world</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;BATMAN: THE LONG HALLOWEEN</strong></p>
<p><strong>Written by Jeph Loeb</strong></p>
<p><strong>Art by Tim Sale</strong></p>
<p>This is hailed as one of the quintessential tales that pulls together almost all of the Batman mythos into one story without betraying or compromising any element. Masterfully rendered, Loeb and Sale examine the entirety of the Batman&rsquo;s world and the effect he has on it.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: This was followed up by BATMAN: DARK VICTORY which went into greater depth on the narratives started in this storyline.</em></p>

<p><strong>BATMAN: ARKHAM ASYLUM</strong></p>
<p><strong>Written by Grant Morrison</strong></p>
<p><strong>Art by Dave McKean</strong></p>
<p>This is my favorite on the list. I believe the reason Batman is so enduring is because of how his rogues&rsquo; gallery offers unique insights into him. The Joker is the man over the edge; Batman is the man on the edge. Two Face is the man who can't deal with his dual identities, Batman is just managing to deal with them. The Scarecrow abuses fear, Batman uses fear. Catwoman uses her gifts for herself, Batman uses them for others.</p>
<p><em>Arkham Asylum</em> is multi-layered. You can read it as Batman going into the asylum, or as Batman confronting his own psychosis, as a tale of Alice in Wonderland or as the passion play: the story of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: Until the Watchmen movie, Arkham Asylum had sold more graphic novels than any other. It is also a text on storytelling in most good film courses.</em></p>

<p><strong>THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Written &amp; drawn by Frank Miller</strong></p>
<p>And the oldest book, that started all this, comes last. If the other works are seminal, then this piece of genius from 1986 is biblical. This conjectural last Batman story redefines the Dark Knight and reinvigorated his place in our society. No character could ask for a better bookend.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: Decades later, Frank was asked to do a sequel and came up with the controversial THE DARK KNIGHT STRIKES AGAIN. A far more irreverent take, lovers of the Dark Knight should beware.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many great Batman stories omitted from this list. But these ten will fill you in on everything you need to know before picking up the controller for <em>Arkham City</em> or buying your ticket for <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>. Those are the essential sights, sounds and smells of Gotham. Consider yourself warned.</p>
<p>So we are now beginning our descent towards Gotham City. Please place your tray tables in their upright position. Put all your canisters of fear gas, utility belts and batarangs away and do buckle your seat belts.</p>
<p>You're in for the bat-ride of your life.</p>

<p><em>NOTE: Recent continuity has tried to theorize that Selena was only posing as a prostitute to try and relieve men of their money.</em></p>

<p><strong><em><img style=""float: left; margin: 2px;"" src=""http://www.flashinglives.com/popgalaxy/batmanwar.png"" alt="""" width=""315"" height=""472"" />7. The Batman visualized</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>BATMAN: WAR ON CRIME</strong></p>
<p><strong>Written by Paul Dini</strong></p>
<p><strong>Art by Alex Ross</strong></p>
<p>Another great book written by the writer of <em>Arkham Asylum</em> (maybe you can see why he got the job?). Alex Ross and Paul Dini ground Batman visually and narratively. It&rsquo;s a good story brilliantly illustrated by Alex Ross. This wonderful, oversized book makes you believe a guy could run around in a bat suit.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: Alex Ross is one of the few artists who wouldn't white out the eyes of his heroes, instead employing the cinematic mask and eye paint we know so well. He also gave Batman brown eyes to visually distinguish him more from the blue-eyed Superman.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em><img style=""float: left; margin: 2px;"" src=""http://www.flashinglives.com/popgalaxy/thelonghalloween.png"" alt="""" width=""330"" height=""507"" /></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>8. The effect the Batman has on his world</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;BATMAN: THE LONG HALLOWEEN</strong></p>
<p><strong>Written by Jeph Loeb</strong></p>
<p><strong>Art by Tim Sale</strong></p>
<p>This is hailed as one of the quintessential tales that pulls together almost all of the Batman mythos into one story without betraying or compromising any element. Masterfully rendered, Loeb and Sale examine the entirety of the Batman&rsquo;s world and the effect he has on it.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: This was followed up by BATMAN: DARK VICTORY which went into greater depth on the narratives started in this storyline.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em><img style=""float: left; margin: 2px;"" src=""http://www.flashinglives.com/popgalaxy/arkhamasylum.png"" alt="""" width=""315"" height=""472"" />9. Inside Batman's mind</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>BATMAN: ARKHAM ASYLUM</strong></p>
<p><strong>Written by Grant Morrison</strong></p>
<p><strong>Art by Dave McKean</strong></p>
<p>This is my favorite on the list. I believe the reason Batman is so enduring is because of how his rogues&rsquo; gallery offers unique insights into him. The Joker is the man over the edge; Batman is the man on the edge. Two Face is the man who can't deal with his dual identities, Batman is just managing to deal with them. The Scarecrow abuses fear, Batman uses fear. Catwoman uses her gifts for herself, Batman uses them for others.</p>
<p><em>Arkham Asylum</em> is multi-layered. You can read it as Batman going into the asylum, or as Batman confronting his own psychosis, as a tale of Alice in Wonderland or as the passion play: the story of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: Until the Watchmen movie, Arkham Asylum had sold more graphic novels than any other. It is also a text on storytelling in most good film courses.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em><img style=""float: left; margin: 2px;"" src=""http://www.flashinglives.com/popgalaxy/darkknightreturns.png"" alt="""" width=""360"" height=""540"" />10. The end that never was</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Written &amp; drawn by Frank Miller</strong></p>
<p>And the oldest book, that started all this, comes last. If the other works are seminal, then this piece of genius from 1986 is biblical. This conjectural last Batman story redefines the Dark Knight and reinvigorated his place in our society. No character could ask for a better bookend.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: Decades later, Frank was asked to do a sequel and came up with the controversial THE DARK KNIGHT STRIKES AGAIN. A far more irreverent take, lovers of the Dark Knight should beware.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many great Batman stories omitted from this list. But these ten will fill you in on everything you need to know before picking up the controller for <em>Arkham City</em> or buying your ticket for <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>. Those are the essential sights, sounds and smells of Gotham. Consider yourself warned.</p>
<p>So we are now beginning our descent towards Gotham City. Please place your tray tables in their upright position. Put all your canisters of fear gas, utility belts and batarangs away and do buckle your seat belts.</p>
<p>You're in for the bat-ride of your life.</p>

<p>The Oscars were last night... and there were 10 nominees, which is a new trend for the show. I personally liked it better when they narrowed it down to 5. That being said, forget the Oscars, I'm going to give you 5 music videos from 2010 that could win an Oscar, if there were such a thing for music videos.</p>
<p>Let's start with the celebrity driven video, ""Gorillaz: Stylo."" This video stars Bruce Willis, and none other than the Gorillaz themselves in classic revved up cars that would make Vin Diesel smile. It's a fun filled ride with a twisted ending.</p>

<p>Who doesn't like cat videos? I'm sorry, but it seems to never get old on YouTube, and with this music video by ""Holy Fuck"", it's still not old. The song, ""Red Lights"" could probably be interpreted into a lot of different ideas, but I'm pretty happy about the direction this video went, with the cats and all...</p>
<p><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/DhaRkWfaq10"" width=""560"" height=""349"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p>As always, you've got to have a really dark glimpse into something with nominees, and I'm going to let M.I.A.'s ""Born Free"" get this nod. It's violent, and well done, and really, what more could you want from M.I.A. besides this video?</p>
<p><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/IeMvUlxXyz8"" width=""560"" height=""349"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p>Did everyone already forget about the Academy Award winning film ""Walk The Line""? I'm going to bring Johnny Cash back to the discussion, and it's because of the video ""Ain't No Grave"" which is always in a changing pattern. This version of it is from 9/30/2010 - and it's amazing. I'm a big fan.</p>
<p><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/WwNVlNt9iDk"" width=""560"" height=""349"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p>...and finally, my favorite video of 2010 involves Star Wars. Yes... Star Wars. This video basically takes us through the trilogy, but is giving all the credit to time spent on Tatooine. Check out Jeremy Messersmith's ""Tatooine.""</p>

<p>This week marks the <a href=""http://www.gdconf.com/"" target=""_blank"">25th Game Developers Conference (GDC)</a> at the Moscone Convention Center in San Francisco, CA. GDC is a gathering of development professionals from around the world, coming together for five days of seminars, lectures, panels, discussions, award presentations, networking opportunities, and a huge expo hall. <br /><br />GDC has been the site of many exciting revelations and announcement in years past. This year holds a lot of potential for huge announcements, as it's the first major games conference of 2011. Here are some highlights of what we'll see this year, as well as what we can fiercely hope to see. <br /><br /><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://www.gdconf.com/img/logos/download/GDC2011_logo_25th_color.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""212"" /><br /><br />- Satoru Iwata, President of <a href=""http://www.nintendo.com/countryselector"" target=""_blank"">Nintendo</a>, gives his keynote address about the history and future of the games industry on Wednesday at 9AM. While that might not be the most interesting-sounding talk in the world, Iwata would be the one who'd be making any exciting announcements in store for Nintendo for 2011 (Skyward Sword trailer, anyone?). <br /><br /><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://www.infendo.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Skyward-Sword.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""300"" /><br /><br />- <a href=""http://www.epicgames.com/"" target=""_blank"">Epic Games</a> will be demoing the next generation of Unreal Engine to a select audience of professionals as well as a few members of the media. This will give us a glimpse into what the future of graphics might look like for games -- and rumor has it that we'll be impressed with what we see. Epic is also supposedly announcing a new IP this year, which will add to their impressive lineup of Bulletstorm and the Gears of War series.<br /><br />- The Game Developers Choice Awards, hosted by TIM SCHAFER! Peter Molyneux, head of Lionhead Studios and creator of the Fable series, will be receiving a lifetime achievement award. They will award the prestigious GDCA Game of the Year award.

<p>This week marks the <a href=""http://www.gdconf.com/"" target=""_blank"">25th Game Developers Conference (GDC)</a> at the Moscone Convention Center in San Francisco, CA. GDC is a gathering of development professionals from around the world, coming together for five days of seminars, lectures, panels, discussions, award presentations, networking opportunities, and a huge expo hall. <br /><br />GDC has been the site of many exciting revelations and announcement in years past. This year holds a lot of potential for huge announcements, as it's the first major games conference of 2011. Here are some highlights of what we'll see this year, as well as what we can fiercely hope to see. <br /><br /><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://www.gdconf.com/img/logos/download/GDC2011_logo_25th_color.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""212"" /><br /><br />- Satoru Iwata, President of <a href=""http://www.nintendo.com/countryselector"" target=""_blank"">Nintendo</a>, gives his keynote address about the history and future of the games industry on Wednesday at 9AM. While that might not be the most interesting-sounding talk in the world, Iwata would be the one who'd be making any exciting announcements in store for Nintendo for 2011 (Skyward Sword trailer, anyone?). <br /><br /><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://www.infendo.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Skyward-Sword.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""300"" /><br /><br />- <a href=""http://www.epicgames.com/"" target=""_blank"">Epic Games</a> will be demoing the next generation of Unreal Engine to a select audience of professionals as well as a few members of the media. This will give us a glimpse into what the future of graphics might look like for games -- and rumor has it that we'll be impressed with what we see. Epic is also supposedly announcing a new IP this year, which will add to their impressive lineup of Bulletstorm and the Gears of War series.<br /><br />- The Game Developers Choice Awards, hosted by TIM SCHAFER! Peter Molyneux, head of Lionhead Studios and creator of the Fable series, will be receiving a lifetime achievement award. They will award the prestigious GDCA Game of the Year award. The frontrunner nominee at present is the indie hit game Limbo, which in my opinion is highly deserving.

Speaking from experience here, if it&rsquo;s horror, I&rsquo;ll  give it a chance. If it&rsquo;s Zombies, I&rsquo;m already sold, even the bad stuff.  But as gruesome as they can draw a page, it will never match what I see  in my own mind, or seeing it in the big screen. Especially with how  desensitized we are as a society to that type of content. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">It&rsquo;s  ironic that with the ending of the Comics Code to find ourselves  heading toward a very exciting time to again the boundary of what can be  done in horror... in the digital age. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">But  what really makes horror scary? Aside from the creepy and gruesome, it  mostly comes down to one thing: &nbsp;The unknown. &ldquo;What is going to happen  next?&rdquo; This is also the main problem with horror in print comics. Even  in a comic with well planned page reveals, you still know what is coming  up as you are reading the page. Typically when you read a comic page,  you first look at the entire page and then start reading it. So how do  you keep the &lsquo;unknown&rsquo; a powerful surprise in comics, as it is in  movies? </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">Well  in print, I just don&rsquo;t think that is possible. However, in digital, we  start to see a few surprises, such as this &ldquo;Walking Dead&rdquo; motion comic: </span></p>

<p>Shut your lights off, put your headphones on and watch this.</p>
<p>This is a great example of how you can take a comic and turn it into a digital experience.</p>
<p>You have Zombies coming from off-screen,  the music and sound effects pull you in, building tension and when he gets hit with the shovel at the end, you&rsquo;re actually surprised. It&rsquo;s not quite a a live action scream fest, but it&rsquo;s headed down the right path.</p>
<p>It also looks like <a href=""http://www.m2action.com"" target=""_blank"">http://www.m2action.com</a> is doing some cool things with their motion comics - even offering a 3D option. Check out the Dead Town one:</p>

<p>By creating stories for digital outlets, designed to be enjoyed with all the lights off, adding video and sound, horror publishers are beginning to bring back that heart pounding, edge-of-your-seat horror experience once believed to be dead and buried.</p>","<p>&nbsp;</p>

Speaking from experience here, if it&rsquo;s horror, I&rsquo;ll  give it a chance. If it&rsquo;s Zombies, I&rsquo;m already sold, even the bad stuff.  But as gruesome as they can draw a page, it will never match what I see  in my own mind, or seeing it in the big screen. Especially with how  desensitized we are as a society to that type of content. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">It&rsquo;s  ironic that with the ending of the Comics Code to find ourselves  heading toward a very exciting time to again the boundary of what can be  done in horror... in the digital age. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">But  what really makes horror scary? Aside from the creepy and gruesome, it  mostly comes down to one thing: &nbsp;The unknown. &ldquo;What is going to happen  next?&rdquo; This is also the main problem with horror in print comics. Even  in a comic with well planned page reveals, you still know what is coming  up as you are reading the page. Typically when you read a comic page,  you first look at the entire page and then start reading it. So how do  you keep the &lsquo;unknown&rsquo; a powerful surprise in comics, as it is in  movies? </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">Well  in print, I just don&rsquo;t think that is possible.

<p>Shut your lights off, put your headphones on and watch this.</p>
<p>This is a great example of how you can take a comic and turn it into a digital experience.</p>
<p>You have Zombies coming from off-screen,  the music and sound effects pull you in, building tension and when he gets hit with the shovel at the end, you&rsquo;re actually surprised. It&rsquo;s not quite a a live action scream fest, but it&rsquo;s headed down the right path.</p>

<p>Johnny Depp and Pirates Of The Caribbean director Gore Verbinski reunite once again to tell this animated tale of a chameleon with a bit of an overactive imagination and a need to belong somewhere.</p>
<p>Rango (Depp) is a chameleon who likes to write/stage/direct his own plays with the only two friends he's ever known - a headless, one armed doll and a wind up fish (popular underground toy, Mr Timms). Due to a very ODD chain of circumstances, Rango finds himself in the town of Dirt; where water is used as currency, the townsfolk are down on their luck and the Mayor (Ned Beatty) is of questionable virtue. Made Sheriff in a town where the cemetery is filled with others who held the title for a short time (one stone read ""Tuesday to Saturday""), Rango has to look inside himself to save the town and in turn, figure out who he REALLY is.</p>

<p>What makes this latest outing from Nickelodeon so special is that they not only teamed up with Industrial Light &amp; Magic to make some OUTSTANDING landscapes and lifelike animals, Verbinski and his team worked to give each character depth and emotion.&nbsp; ILM's Tim Alexander said that during recording, the actors spent a great deal of time at Universal and were given costumes and sets to help them really get the feel of the Old (and Wild) West.</p>
<p>Well, guess what? IT WORKED.</p>
<p>Yes, it's a film geared and marketed toward children but there's a STRONG possibility that adults will love this movie MORE than their kids.&nbsp; There are some VERY recognizable pop culture 'easter egg' characters that when they appeared on screen, people (myself included) lost our minds with laughter and in one instance, elicited a ton of ""NO WAY"" and ""OMG"" responses followed by a round of applause once the scene was over. What makes this a big deal is that there was still 20 minutes to go.</p>
<p>The animation is so meticulous and so crisp that there were times I was convinced that there HAD to be some live action and animatronic animals mixed in.&nbsp; I must've said ""Wow"" at least 20 times during the film.</p>

<p>It's been a VERY long time since an animated film has made me cry and Rango is the first film in AGES where I not only found myself emotionally invested in EVERY character but I actually cried (quietly, of course). It's a testament to Depp because I was VERY skeptical that he could hold up a film where he couldn't rely on snarky looks or doing ""Jack Sparrow-like"" behaviors. I was so wrong. Depp has restored my faith in his acting abilities because after the POTC series, I wasn't so sure he could do or be anything else.</p>

Grouping in 2008, the fast rise in their popularity sprouts from their entrancing live performances, the creative forces of the rocker foursome and the notes that Steven Wilkin can elevate to.&nbsp; You definitely want to press the <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/vanaprasta"" target=""_blank"">Like</a> button on this one, and beat all your friends to say you found &lsquo;em first.</p>
<p>The song &lsquo;Minnesota&rsquo; haunts you with the echoes of synth and Wilkin&rsquo;s high melodic sighs, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re both seasons, we both come and go,&rdquo; should be the tag line for the band. The combination of gut wrenching composition and yearning vocals makes one wish they had a girlfriend or boyfriend to break up with to justify listening to Vanaprasta more. &lsquo;Color of Sin&rsquo; is their catchiest tune and hand clapping is more than appropriate. I have had many shameless sing along sessions in L.A. traffic, lemme tell ya, the clapping cannot be helped. Check out the music video for &ldquo;Healthy Geometry&rdquo;, it is a simple showcase of the band with a simple vision.</p>

<p>From their originals to their covers of LCD Soundsystem and even Kanye West, they&rsquo;ll keep you in the Vanaprasta zone. The name Vanaprasta hails from the Hindi life system. As the third step in life transitioning, &ldquo;Vanaprasta may be termed as the beginning of a person's real 'adult education' to evaluate his performance thus for as Grihasta and reorder his life in such a way as to discover who he is and what life is all about.&rdquo; (mailerindia.com)</p>

<p>A fitting name for this band that is in constant challenge of itself and constantly striving- not only for giving they&rsquo;re all towards their music, but also for themselves. Their symbol of the equilateral triangle is not only a band symbol, but for their lifestyle they lead-balanced, equal and illuminated.</p>

<p>Their EP &ldquo;Forming the Shapes&rdquo; is available on iTunes and their highly anticipated LP will be released this year. Their 7-inch vinyl featuring the songs &lsquo;Minnesota&rsquo; and &lsquo;Skinny State&rsquo; are available for all those retro loving hipsters. What I love most about them is that they leave everything open to interpretation and no apologies for their vision and sound.</p>

<p>These days, the announcement of an anticipated sequel to a successful franchise or (less frequently) an inventive new IP is followed almost immediately with a proclamation of how breathtaking the new graphics system will be, how realistic the facial animation, how lush the environment. Technology is moving forward in leaps and bounds in this regard, and it's terribly exciting to see it unfold. Remember how the first Tomb Raider looked? That was only <em>fifteen years ago</em>. Kinda mind-blowing, right? Well, it is to me. You kids today, with your hippity hoppity.</p>
<p>I'm personally of the opinion that the storylines and interactivity of games have taken a backseat to the power of modern graphics engines. There are exceptions, of course, and many games are bringing terrific writing to bear as well, but sacrifices get made for the sake of visual effects. Why, back in my day, story and creativity were <em>king</em>, I tell you!</p>
<p>Presented here are the top five games (of many) that completely enraptured me as a kid, and which I'd gladly pick up and play even today.   <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. The Incredible Machine</strong><br />Something in the water at Sierra just spoke to me in the '90s. Between this series and the Castle of Dr. Brain, I credit Sierra with a large part of my present genius. For those of you who never played this game, the objective was to use a given set of objects and pieces to create a Rube Goldberg device and accomplish an objective. Objects ranged from the obvious (electric fans, basketballs, trampolines) to the bizarre (cats, mice, people). There have been many games like this since then, and every time I run across one, I always want to pour one out for the Incredible Machine.</p>
<p><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/09FnpoZ7x64"" width=""480"" height=""390"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>4. Super Bomberman</strong> <br />Before you ask: yeah, I own the modern Bomberman game for the 360 <em>and</em> all the expansion packs for it. There was and remains almost no party game more fun than Bomberman. There, I said it and I meant it.   For the uninitiated, Super Bomberman is a top-down game where you and three friends/CPU players control four little multicolored dudes running around dropping bombs. You have to clear your way out of your particular corner and pick up powerups along the way to annihilate your three friends, who are doing the same thing. Something about this game is utterly hypnotizing to the young mind, and it's a game that is actually based on skill -- you will get better the more you play. And the first time you play, you will get decimated. Just the way it goes.</p>

<p><strong>3. King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow</strong> <br />Again with the Sierra love. King's Quest VI is usually heralded as the best one in the series -- I've since played a few of the others, and I have to agree. In an era where point-and-click adventure games were in their heyday, King's Quest VI really stood above the pack. The storyline was engaging and wickedly clever; the voice acting was awesome; and the puzzles, though sometimes a little bizarre, were never totally impossible. AGD Interactive has started remaking the King's Quest games with updated assets. <a href=""http://www.agdinteractive.com/games/kq3/about/overview.html"">King's Quest III</a> is their latest offering; if you've never experienced King's Quest, do yourself a favor and check it out.  <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/1EAZnVJYCH0"" width=""480"" height=""390"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>2. Creatures</strong> <br />I still don't quite know how popular this game was to the outside world, but I was completely consumed by it. Creatures was an ""artificial life"" game. You hatched cute little bug-eyed mammalian critters called Norns, who lived in a donut-shaped world called Albia. Norns were incredibly cute, trusting, and naive, which, if left untended, led them almost always into certain doom. From their infancy, you taught them words (which you could change to any language or nonsense if you chose), praised them, punished them, and so raised them to live in a perilous world. The coolest part of this game was that your Norns had a genetic structure: you could breed adult Norns for certain traits, which would become extremely pronounced down through their offspring. Later expansions had extremely advanced genetic and neural panels for the obsessive Norn breeders like myself.  I've played Spore and Black &amp; White and plenty of the Sim games since my experience with Creatures, but nothing comes close to that bizarre connection I had to my little Norns. Sniffle.</p>

<p><strong>1. Star Wars: TIE Fighter</strong> <br />As far as single player games go, there's never been anything that has held my attention so fiercely as TIE Fighter did, playthrough after playthrough. It's probably fairly obvious from the title, but TIE Fighter was a space combat/flight simulator game. You start as a young TIE fighter pilot at the bottom of the Empire's ranks, hunting down pirates, traitorous Imperials, and of course stymying the occasional Rebel attack. In addition to advancing through the Imperial ranks, you can optionally complete secondary objectives which earn you an increasingly respected position in the Emperor's Inner Circle, a secret society that gets a sweet tribal tattoo.</p>

<p><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/puvD_FDS_jE"" width=""480"" height=""390"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p>Sadly, this game is ridiculously hard to track down, and I think the one time I was able to find it, it didn't run at all on modern Windows. Someday I'm gonna wake up and they'll have rereleased it, just for me. I hope Emperor Palpatine will forgive my absence.</p>

<p>In the mid-90's, about the time that Joel Schumacher decided to destroy the Batman movie franchise, he also got a trend going with Superhero movies, this trend was to go big with the Soundtrack, and produce music videos on the set. Today, we're going to check out the 5 best (or worst - depending on how you look at it) superhero movie music videos.</p>
<p>Let's start with the obvious - SEAL's ""Kiss From A Rose"" - if this video doesn't get you in the romantic mood, than what would?! You really can't ask for more ""cheese"" from a song, or a music video, and this ""Batman Forever"" tie-in delivers!</p>
<p><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/AMD2TwRvuoU"" width=""560"" height=""349"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p>Shaquille O'Neal Feat Ice Cube, B-Real, Peter Gunz &amp; KRS One - Men Of Steel. Should I even say more? This track and music video is from Shaq's movie ""Steel"" - which was a huge failure, but the soundtrack didn't do bad, and it turns out, Shaq is a Platinum Selling artist! Yeah... who knew.</p>
<p><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/2ur0LznXfGc"" width=""560"" height=""349"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p>I really wasn't sure what was better/worse... R. Kelly's ""Gotham City"" or Jewel's ""Foolish Games"" - both videos are a disaster, or brilliant, but after watching R. Kelly's again, I couldn't help but put it in this list. Turns out, it's a really hard video to find the original version of, so it's being hosted out of Japan!</p>

<p>Another brilliant ballad is ""Hero"" which is a duet by Nickelback's Chad Kroeger and Saliva's Josey Scott - this was the theme song to the first Spider-Man film. I'm curious what the reboot is going to bring us, but until then, we have this 'masterpiece'.</p>

<p>Dare Devil's ""Bring Me Back To Life"" from Evanescense has also made my list. For some reason, the superhero movie genre gets a lot of really emotional songs, and Dare Devil was probably victim to the worst soundtrack in superhero history.</p>

<p>A game writer at a large convention will occasionally book a variety  of meetings with a company just to be polite. Such was the case with the  latest <em>Mortal Kombat</em> game. I agreed to the meeting only because of my interest in <em>Batman: Arkham City</em>,  as both games are being published by Warner Bros. In such cases,  writers go into the meeting, dutifully play for a few minutes while  listening to the pitch, and never think of the game again. Yes, it  sounds dishonest, but it's also a defense mechanism against being  overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Here's the problem with that plan: <em>Mortal Kombat</em> is very  good.

<p>WHO would enjoy this?</p>
<p>Readers who:</p>
<p>Enjoyed IRON MAN and IRON MAN 2.<br />If you&rsquo;re looking forward to the CAPTAIN AMERICA and THOR films.<br />Modern, mature and smart mainstream comic books.<br />Highly detailed and realistic widescreen art.</p>

<p>HOW SHOULD YOU READ THE ULTIMATES?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve seen Iron Man 2, you know that Nick Fury played by Samuel L. Jackson is putting together a team for the Avenger&rsquo;s initiative. Imagine that Tony Stark built a bigger and badder Iron Man suit, they called it the ULTIMATES instead, and then start reading.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t seen Iron Man 2, then just start reading. The beauty of this book is that it doesn&rsquo;t require any foreknowledge at all.</p>
<p>How the hell did they manage that?!</p>
<p>Well&hellip;</p>
<p>Back in 1963, Stan Lee came up with the idea that Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Captain America, &nbsp;Ant Man and the Wasp should team up to fight menaces greater than any one single hero could face:</p>

<p>Almost 40 years later in 2002, two English comic book masters, Mark Millar (creator of Kick Ass &amp; Wanted) and Bryan Hitch teamed up to re-imagine a set of events that would bring a modern version of this team together:</p>
<p><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://www.flashinglives.com/popgalaxy/ultimates.png"" alt="""" width=""486"" height=""379"" /></p>
<p>Bryan Hitch&rsquo;s artwork is nothing short of epic, and seminal. You can see from these pages the level of detail and intensity he places into his work. If this book had a visual production budget, it would be in the hundreds of millions.</p>
<p>Mark Millar&rsquo;s trademark self-indulgent humor punctuates what is otherwise an extraordinarily intelligent take on these seminal characters. His unique perspective on these essential characters has permeated its way through to the silver screen. The light-hearted, devil-may-care Tony Stark we fell in love with through Robert Downey Jr. was first born in the pages of the ULTIMATES.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, fairy tale movies were all the rage and we couldn't get enough of them&hellip;then we grew up. In the last year, we've seen some fairly strange decisions come out of Hollywood (INCLUDING making U.S. versions of foreign films that had BARELY BEEN OUT A YEAR) and now we're once again looking at a resurgence of a genre that really should've been left to the two people that did it best: Disney and HBO (Fairy Tale Theatre).</p>
<p>Fairy tale films are being sliced, diced, revamped and remade into live action ho-hum fare that makes me wonder if Hollywood has truly run out of ideas. I mean, there are SO many versions of Jack and The Beanstalk that I could LITERALLY construct a beanstalk out of the miles of film devoted strictly to this story.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Beastly</strong> - ""A modern-day take on the ""Beauty and the Beast"" tale where a New York teen is transformed into a hideous monster in order to find true love."" <strong>is an absolute JOKE to me.</strong><strong> </strong>I have NO clue why people consider THIS ugly (insert image) when I see dudes like this EVERY DAY in Los Angeles who have ZERO problems getting laid. The 'Beast' in this film looks like a weak version of the Tattooed Man from the Jim Rose Circus Sideshow. It was nice to see Mary-Kate Olsen doing something without Ashley but this movie SUCKS and apparently the SMART kids skipped this superficial P.O.S. and opted to see Rango instead, which both opened March 4th weekend. If you REALLY want to see this movie (or take your significant other as a form of punishment), I'd go soon because I don't see this movie staying in theaters past next weekend.</p>

<p><strong>Red Riding Hood</strong> - From the teasers and trailers, I honestly have NO clue what is going on in this film OTHER than it stars Amanda Seyfried and Gary Oldman; is directed by Catherine Hardwicke (Twilight) and opens March 11th.&nbsp; EVERY TIME I see the trailer, my brain starts to trail off like the SNL version of Miley Cyrus, ""So is she like in love with a guy who's also a werewolf or does she know he's a werewolf or is he a bad guy who killed someone she loved or is he her one true friend and the only one who can set him free or what and where does Grandma play into all this?"" (taken from ACTUAL phone conversation with my EIC at Pop Galaxy last night).</p>

<p>So of course, your humble narrator HAD to consult the 'bible' a.k.a. IMDB; here's the SHORT version: ""Set in a medieval village that is haunted by a werewolf, a young girl falls for an orphaned woodcutter, much to her family's displeasure.""</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Okay, FIRST of all, in EVERY version of Red Riding Hood that I KNOW, the woodcutter has ALWAYS been portrayed as an older man who BEFRIENDS Red and subsequently saves her and Grandma from the Big Bad Wolf. NEVER once have I seen a version where there's Romeo and Juliet action going and I really STILL have no desire to see that. Also, Red's name has ALWAYS been ""RED"" - NOW I'm supposed to call her 'Valerie'?! WHATEVER.</p>

</p>
<p>But considering who's directing it, NOT too surprised to see forbidden love mixed with a werewolf's existence AND 'a werewolf killed my sister' theme (BOO, btw) in this so-called 'adult re-telling'.</p>
<p>Not even Gary Oldman will get me to see this film. PASS.</p>
<p>I'll stick to THIS version, thanks.</p>

<p>***As there are currently TWO Snow White films in production and at this point I have little to no desire to see either one, here's why.</p>
<p><strong>The Brothers Grimm: Snow White</strong> - Scheduled for release in 2012, the imdb blurb says it's 'A dark twist on the classic fairy tale, in which Snow White and the seven dwarfs look to reclaim their destroyed kingdom.'&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, sounds great in theory but then I see who's directing and who's signed on so far and now I'm not so sure. Directed by Tarsem Singh, best known for R.E.M.'s 'Losing My Religion' video DOES have some visually impressive films like 'The Cell' under his belt so the frosted, fun side of me has NO doubt the film will be great to look at but the snarky, wheat side will wonder when some Michael Stipe-type of icon will pop up in the film. Whoever is playing Snow White has not been confirmed but Julia Roberts as The Evil Queen? GIVE ME A BREAK. I'd go see it if ERIC Roberts played The Evil Queen, at least THEN it would be something worth talking about.</p>
<p><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://www.fmtaccess.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/brothers-grimm_snow_white.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""340"" /></p>
<p><strong>Snow White and The Huntsman </strong>- Also scheduled for release in 2012 (hey, maybe you two should've talked), THIS film HAS their Snow White&hellip; are you ready for this? It's Kristen Stewart. That's right Kristen 'Hey, I'm really not that talented, have ONE expression and am completely monotone yet have managed to make a career out of it so I better make while the getting's good' Stewart has confirmed that she is indeed Snow White for this latest go-round. The problem? Snow White is extroverted, beauty, grace, charm and PURE innocence. Kristen Stewart is introverted, awkward, boring, dark, can't act for s**t and I grow increasingly tired of her one-note performances. Matter of fact, a couple years ago I started the 'Kristen Stewart Drinking Game' where you take a drink every time she messes with her hair on screen.</p>
<p><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://thespotlightreport.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/o-kristen-stewart-in-talks-to-star-in-snow-white-and-the-huntsman.jpg?w=535&amp;h=401"" alt="""" width=""535"" height=""401"" /></p>
<p>Other problems? The film is CALLED Snow White which means Snow White should be the main focus but with the casting of Academy Award winner Charlize Theron as The Evil Queen and Academy Award nominee Viggo Mortensen as The Huntsman, I'm pretty sure Snow will be taking a back seat to these two powerhouses. Because unless the RIDICULOUSLY good looking Theron 'uglies up' like she did in 'Monster', there's NO WAY anyone will even remember Stewart's name when the film is over.</p>
<p>Also, 'Snow White and The Huntsman&rsquo;? I really hope that's a working title because right now it sounds like a 50's kitch music act like Sam The Sham And The Pharaohs (Wooly Bully, you heathens).</p>
<p><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://screencrave.frsucrave.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/viggo-mortensen-27-1-11-kc.jpg"" alt="""" width=""560"" height=""410"" /></p>
<p>While I am in TOTAL agreement with the age appropriate casting of Mortensen as The Huntsman, I am wondering WHY he's a huntsman and NOT a woodsman&hellip; but who cares? Viggo is much like a groundhog now, only popping up once a year to make a film so in THAT vein&hellip; I'm a LITTLE curious to see what he's going to do with it. I just wish he was coming to the surface to somehow be in The Hobbit but I'll settle for this. Did I also mention that I have a wicked crush on him? Okay, this one will go in the 'maybe' pile.</p>
<p>**AND just like Snow White, there's ALSO two Hansel and Gretel films slated to come out over the next 12 months. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hansel and Gretel in 3D - </strong>Is still in development and I hope it stays there. They don't even have a prelim casting and are boasting it will be an 'action packed visual FX filled version of the classic tale' with the tagline ""If you end up lost in the woods&hellip; you may just find yourself"". Neat, is that the day the Teddy Bears have their picnic? Because otherwise, PASS.</p>
<p><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://www.deviantart.com/download/40340449/Hansel_and_Gretel_by_Ebae.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""440"" /></p>
<p><strong>Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters - </strong>In this film, we catch up with brother/sister team Hansel and Gretel 15 years after the famous ""Gingerbread House"" incident, who've now become bounty hunters who hunt witches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why this particular film of all the bunch could work: it's co-written/directed by Tommy Wirkola (Dead Snow); produced by Will Ferrell, Chris Henchy, Adam McKay, Kevin J. Messick; and stars Jeremy Renner, Gemma Arterton, Famke Janssen AND Peter Stormare.</p>
<p><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://gordonandthewhale.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/HANSEL-AND-GRETEL-WITCH-HUNTERS-450x312.png"" alt="""" width=""450"" height=""312"" /></p>
<p>This film is being billed as a horror comedy and I feel that it's the PERFECT way to go; it's not taking itself seriously and doesn't expect you as an audience member to, either. Jeremy Renner has come a LOOOOOONG way from his 7-11 'Slurpee Brain Freeze' commercial (remember the one where you hear a guy off camera alternately yelling in pain and sighing in pleasure while his dog's ears go up and down in curiosity? YEP!) And has made his bones in this industry as a solid go to guy when it comes to making slightly tweaked out characters accessible. With films like 'Dahmer' and 'The Hurt Locker' under his belt, I can't WAIT to see what he does in this one!!</p>
<p>NOT a fan of Gemma Arterton (Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time) BUT knowing Famke Janssen and Peter Stormare (Fargo, The Big Lebowski) are there to round out the principal cast makes me kind of giddy. Stormare can go from scary as EFF to funny as EFF in nothing FLAT and I LOVE him for it!!!</p>
<p>What this film sounds like it'll be to me is Dead Snow meets Buffy The Vampire Slayer (FILM VERSION, heathens) with HILARIOUSLY gory results. Paramount's been pretty consistent with horror as of late and since it'll be in 3-D, I'll wager 50 bucks that it'll be 'Piranha 3-D' campy levels of gore and fun - which is the way it should be.</p>
<p>H &amp; G: WH is slated for release in 2012 and I am SO READY! Put this one in the ""ABSOLUTELY I'm seeing this pile!""</p>
<p>The Frame Rate:</p>
<p><strong>Beastly</strong> - WHATEVER. Superficial tripe aimed at teenagers who opted to either stay in for a Teen Mom 2 marathon or saw the BETTER film that weekend: Rango.</p>
<p><strong>Snow White</strong> - Bleh</p>
<p><strong>Snow White and The Huntsman</strong> - Meh (but I love me some Viggo, so I'll probably go).</p>
<p><strong>Hansel and Gretel in 3-D</strong> - GET OUTTA MY FACE BEFORE I KILL YOU.</p>
<p><strong>Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters</strong> - Jeremy Renner, I seriously love you. Please make out with me. I mean, uh, SOOOOO Crix Approved.</p>
<p>So some people are getting their wish - Zombies are out and Fairy Tales are in&hellip;but bigger doesn't necessarily mean better, so be careful what you wish for.</p>
<p>P.S. the BEST version of Jack and The Beanstalk is the 1974 animated version starring Jack Grimes as the Giant (who we learn is named 'Tulip'). This film STILL scares the absolute hell out of me and is unlike ANY animated fairy tale film EVER.

It was nice to see Mary-Kate Olsen doing something without Ashley but this movie SUCKS and apparently the SMART kids skipped this superficial P.O.S. and opted to see Rango instead, which both opened March 4th weekend. If you REALLY want to see this movie (or take your significant other as a form of punishment), I'd go soon because I don't see this movie staying in theaters past next weekend.</p>

<p><strong>Red Riding Hood</strong> - From the teasers and trailers, I honestly have NO clue what is going on in this film OTHER than it stars Amanda Seyfried and Gary Oldman; is directed by Catherine Hardwicke (Twilight) and opens March 11th.&nbsp; EVERY TIME I see the trailer, my brain starts to trail off like the SNL version of Miley Cyrus, ""So is she like in love with a guy who's also a werewolf or does she know he's a werewolf or is he a bad guy who killed someone she loved or is he her one true friend and the only one who can set him free or what and where does Grandma play into all this?"" (taken from ACTUAL phone conversation with my EIC at Pop Galaxy last night).</p>

<p>So of course, your humble narrator HAD to consult the 'bible' a.k.a. IMDB; here's the SHORT version: ""Set in a medieval village that is haunted by a werewolf, a young girl falls for an orphaned woodcutter, much to her family's displeasure.""</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Okay, FIRST of all, in EVERY version of Red Riding Hood that I KNOW, the woodcutter has ALWAYS been portrayed as an older man who BEFRIENDS Red and subsequently saves her and Grandma from the Big Bad Wolf. NEVER once have I seen a version where there's Romeo and Juliet action going and I really STILL have no desire to see that. Also, Red's name has ALWAYS been ""RED"" - NOW I'm supposed to call her 'Valerie'?! WHATEVER.</p>

</p>
<p>But considering who's directing it, NOT too surprised to see forbidden love mixed with a werewolf's existence AND 'a werewolf killed my sister' theme (BOO, btw) in this so-called 'adult re-telling'.</p>
<p>Not even Gary Oldman will get me to see this film. PASS.</p>
<p>I'll stick to THIS version, thanks.</p>

<p>***As there are currently TWO Snow White films in production and at this point I have little to no desire to see either one, here's why.</p>
<p><strong>The Brothers Grimm: Snow White</strong> - Scheduled for release in 2012, the imdb blurb says it's 'A dark twist on the classic fairy tale, in which Snow White and the seven dwarfs look to reclaim their destroyed kingdom.'&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, sounds great in theory but then I see who's directing and who's signed on so far and now I'm not so sure. Directed by Tarsem Singh, best known for R.E.M.'s 'Losing My Religion' video DOES have some visually impressive films like 'The Cell' under his belt so the frosted, fun side of me has NO doubt the film will be great to look at but the snarky, wheat side will wonder when some Michael Stipe-type of icon will pop up in the film. Whoever is playing Snow White has not been confirmed but Julia Roberts as The Evil Queen? GIVE ME A BREAK. I'd go see it if ERIC Roberts played The Evil Queen, at least THEN it would be something worth talking about.</p>
<p><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://www.fmtaccess.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/brothers-grimm_snow_white.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""340"" /></p>
<p><strong>Snow White and The Huntsman </strong>- Also scheduled for release in 2012 (hey, maybe you two should've talked), THIS film HAS their Snow White&hellip; are you ready for this? It's Kristen Stewart. That's right Kristen 'Hey, I'm really not that talented, have ONE expression and am completely monotone yet have managed to make a career out of it so I better make while the getting's good' Stewart has confirmed that she is indeed Snow White for this latest go-round. The problem? Snow White is extroverted, beauty, grace, charm and PURE innocence. Kristen Stewart is introverted, awkward, boring, dark, can't act for s**t and I grow increasingly tired of her one-note performances. Matter of fact, a couple years ago I started the 'Kristen Stewart Drinking Game' where you take a drink every time she messes with her hair on screen.</p>
<p><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://thespotlightreport.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/o-kristen-stewart-in-talks-to-star-in-snow-white-and-the-huntsman.jpg?w=535&amp;h=401"" alt="""" width=""535"" height=""401"" /></p>
<p>Other problems? The film is CALLED Snow White which means Snow White should be the main focus but with the casting of Academy Award winner Charlize Theron as The Evil Queen and Academy Award nominee Viggo Mortensen as The Huntsman, I'm pretty sure Snow will be taking a back seat to these two powerhouses. Because unless the RIDICULOUSLY good looking Theron 'uglies up' like she did in 'Monster', there's NO WAY anyone will even remember Stewart's name when the film is over.</p>
<p>Also, 'Snow White and The Huntsman&rsquo;? I really hope that's a working title because right now it sounds like a 50's kitch music act like Sam The Sham And The Pharaohs (Wooly Bully, you heathens).</p>
<p><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://screencrave.frsucrave.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/viggo-mortensen-27-1-11-kc.jpg"" alt="""" width=""560"" height=""410"" /></p>
<p>While I am in TOTAL agreement with the age appropriate casting of Mortensen as The Huntsman, I am wondering WHY he's a huntsman and NOT a woodsman&hellip; but who cares? Viggo is much like a groundhog now, only popping up once a year to make a film so in THAT vein&hellip; I'm a LITTLE curious to see what he's going to do with it. I just wish he was coming to the surface to somehow be in The Hobbit but I'll settle for this. Did I also mention that I have a wicked crush on him? Okay, this one will go in the 'maybe' pile.</p>
<p>**AND just like Snow White, there's ALSO two Hansel and Gretel films slated to come out over the next 12 months. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hansel and Gretel in 3D - </strong>Is still in development and I hope it stays there. They don't even have a prelim casting and are boasting it will be an 'action packed visual FX filled version of the classic tale' with the tagline ""If you end up lost in the woods&hellip; you may just find yourself"". Neat, is that the day the Teddy Bears have their picnic? Because otherwise, PASS.</p>
<p><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://www.deviantart.com/download/40340449/Hansel_and_Gretel_by_Ebae.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""440"" /></p>
<p><strong>Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters - </strong>In this film, we catch up with brother/sister team Hansel and Gretel 15 years after the famous ""Gingerbread House"" incident, who've now become bounty hunters who hunt witches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why this particular film of all the bunch could work: it's co-written/directed by Tommy Wirkola (Dead Snow); produced by Will Ferrell, Chris Henchy, Adam McKay, Kevin J. Messick; and stars Jeremy Renner, Gemma Arterton, Famke Janssen AND Peter Stormare.</p>
<p><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://gordonandthewhale.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/HANSEL-AND-GRETEL-WITCH-HUNTERS-450x312.png"" alt="""" width=""450"" height=""312"" /></p>
<p>This film is being billed as a horror comedy and I feel that it's the PERFECT way to go; it's not taking itself seriously and doesn't expect you as an audience member to, either. Jeremy Renner has come a LOOOOOONG way from his 7-11 'Slurpee Brain Freeze' commercial (remember the one where you hear a guy off camera alternately yelling in pain and sighing in pleasure while his dog's ears go up and down in curiosity? YEP!) And has made his bones in this industry as a solid go to guy when it comes to making slightly tweaked out characters accessible. With films like 'Dahmer' and 'The Hurt Locker' under his belt, I can't WAIT to see what he does in this one!!</p>
<p>NOT a fan of Gemma Arterton (Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time) BUT knowing Famke Janssen and Peter Stormare (Fargo, The Big Lebowski) are there to round out the principal cast makes me kind of giddy. Stormare can go from scary as EFF to funny as EFF in nothing FLAT and I LOVE him for it!!!</p>
<p>What this film sounds like it'll be to me is Dead Snow meets Buffy The Vampire Slayer (FILM VERSION, heathens) with HILARIOUSLY gory results. Paramount's been pretty consistent with horror as of late and since it'll be in 3-D, I'll wager 50 bucks that it'll be 'Piranha 3-D' campy levels of gore and fun - which is the way it should be.</p>
<p>H &amp; G: WH is slated for release in 2012 and I am SO READY! Put this one in the ""ABSOLUTELY I'm seeing this pile!""</p>
<p>The Frame Rate:</p>
<p><strong>Beastly</strong> - WHATEVER. Superficial tripe aimed at teenagers who opted to either stay in for a Teen Mom 2 marathon or saw the BETTER film that weekend: Rango.</p>
<p><strong>Snow White</strong> - Bleh</p>
<p><strong>Snow White and The Huntsman</strong> - Meh (but I love me some Viggo, so I'll probably go).</p>
<p><strong>Hansel and Gretel in 3-D</strong> - GET OUTTA MY FACE BEFORE I KILL YOU.</p>
<p><strong>Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters</strong> - Jeremy Renner, I seriously love you. Please make out with me. I mean, uh, SOOOOO Crix Approved.</p>
<p>So some people are getting their wish - Zombies are out and Fairy Tales are in&hellip;but bigger doesn't necessarily mean better, so be careful what you wish for.</p>
<p>P.S. the BEST version of Jack and The Beanstalk is the 1974 animated version starring Jack Grimes as the Giant (who we learn is named 'Tulip'). This film STILL scares the absolute hell out of me and is unlike ANY animated fairy tale film EVER.

<p>Seattle and its nearby suburbs are major hubs for game studios both  large and small. Seattle has PopCap and NCSoft, Redmond has Nintendo  and Microsoft Games, Bellevue is home to Valve, Bungie, and ArenaNet --  and those are just a few of the bigger names.  The entire area is peppered with smaller studios and indie developers  creating incredibly cool games that may not get a huge marketing  budget.</p>
<p>I'm on a mission to talk about those studios. Today is the  introduction to what I hope will be a series of spotlights on local  independent game studios, showing off their efforts and exposing more  people to what is often pure, concentrated radness.</p>
<p>My quest begins thusly.</p>
<p>JUMALA<a href=""https://owa.mex02.emailsrvr.com/owa/redir.aspx?C=15fbf67dd8aa4154a90eb9a9076d2c99&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fjumala.com"" target=""_blank""><br /></a><a href=""http://jumala.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://jumala.com<br /></a>Release: TBA (Closed beta begins March 31)<br />Price: Free</p>
<p>Jumala is the very picture of indie developer -- a smaller studio,  15 employees, nestled in an office building in Bellevue, WA. A handsome  arcade cabinet with a huge array of games greets you on entering, next  to a cozy XBOX 360 setup. I immediately feel  comfortable here: games are clearly the great love in this office.</p>
<p>I'm greeted by Sara Girard, the community marketing manager, and  Frank Savage, the company CTO. A little company background: Jumala may  be small and independent, but it is by no means inexperienced. The  leadership at Jumala has put in serious time at companies  like Nintendo, Disney, and Microsoft. Frank's resume alone is  impressive: he worked on MechCommander and other similar titles before  moving on to form the Microsft XNA Game Studio team -- famous for  releasing XNA Game Studio Express, which allows ""hobbyist""  game developers to rapidly develop their own games.</p>
<p>This love of putting game development in the hands of the layman  has clearly been the driving force behind Jumala. Frank, Sara, and I sit  down for a hands-on demo, and Frank gives me the lowdown as the game  loads.</p>
<p>Jumala is a game whose objective is to build games. Create your own  games, play games that your friends have built, participate in the  building community, collaborate with others to make something really  terrific -- these are the major tenets of Jumala.  If you're thinking of Little Big Planet or Minecraft, you're not far  wrong, but Jumala has improved on both of these concepts a bit: you're  not constrained by Little Big Planet's established aesthetic or  two-dimensionality, nor by Minecraft's unit-based brick-building  system. Jumala is three-dimensional, and its design and structure is  dictated by you.</p>
<p><img src=""http://flashinglives.com/popgalaxy/Jumalascreenshot1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""343"" /></p>
<p>Boot up Jumala for the first time and you'll see the Dashboard.  This is your control panel. Here's where you'll choose what to do: build  a game, play someone else's game, participate in the community, do some  quests -- you'll never be without something  to do.</p>
<p>There's a lot to discuss here, but I'll focus on Jumala's primary objective: game creation.</p>
<p>We load up a premade game as a starting point -- it's a Pirate  themed map called Treasure Island. The first thing I notice is that the  graphics are very cartoony and skew a bit young. Frank assures me that's  a property of this particular map; there are  other premade themes that will be much darker. We bounce around and  collect some glowing pink skulls; an evil pumpkin starts chasing us,  hellbent on destruction.</p>
<p>Here's where things get cool: Frank pauses the game, and suddenly  we're using sliders and checkboxes to edit the properties of that evil  pumpkin. We can change its aggressive behavior pattern, its radius of  attack, how much damage it does, how long it  chases us, and a handful of other variables normally controlled by code  in the background.</p>
<p>We apply a ""sway in wind"" property to a palm tree and unpause the  game -- it sways gently in the breeze. We apply a ""sway in wind""  property to a stoic looking pile of boulders -- they sway gently in the  breeze. Sure, it doesn't make sense, but it demonstrates  just how free the creation really is in this game. You can even create a  game whose challenges require the player to edit your map with Jumala's  tools in order to solve the puzzles you've set, gamifying the actual  game creation process. Layers within layers,  friends.</p>
<p>Frank demonstrates how nearly every object, texture, and behavior  in this game is editable. Our character is still very low-level, so he's  only unlocked a few sets of actions -- as we level up, we'll unlock  more functionality.</p>
<p><img src=""http://flashinglives.com/popgalaxy/Jumalascreenshot3.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""343"" /></p>
<p>Jumala is a game that encourages cooperative creation. For example,  say you're a great object artist but you hate environment design. You  partner up with an environment artist through the community and together  you two build a stunning game experience,  getting achievements and game rewards in the process.</p>
<p>In my opinion, Jumala is a no-brainer for game development courses.  Though it doesn't currently support editing your game's code, it  provides a solid introduction to object-oriented programming and could  serve as a way to prototype game concepts.</p>
<p>The price tag? Free dollars! Jumala has no retail fee; they're  planning to make their money selling game assets -- objects, textures,  behaviors -- most for under a dollar.</p>
<p>The potential with Jumala is pretty staggering. They're dreaming  big: they want to make co-op gameplay possible, with the ability to set  your own achievements in-game for your players, and even eventually be  able to create and sell your OWN game assets  and level designs in the Jumala store.</p>
<p>Interested? You should be! Jumala enters closed beta at the end of  this month, and I've got some beta keys to give away. Just come follow  me on Twitter @SheGeekShow and send me a tweet with ""JUMALA BETA!"" in it  somewhere, and I'll enter you in the drawing!</p>

<p><br />It seems it's possible to get a pretty solid music video done these days for a major label band for about $50,000... but in the past, video budgets were pretty large. Let's take a look at the 5 most expensive music videos ever produced.</p>
<p>5. Puff Daddy (featuring The Notorious B.I.G. and Busta Rhymes) &ndash; &ldquo;Victory&rdquo; - $2.7 million</p>

<p>This ""futuristic"" video features Dennis Hopper and Danny DeVito and feels like a bad rip-off of Demolition Man, The Running Man, and Blade Runner. It's not a good video, but it was made, and cost a lot of money, so perhaps that's a good enough reason to give it a view?</p>

<p>Madonna and expensive are two words that have a place in music video history... she makes this list twice. That being said, I'm not really sure what's going on in this video, but it does have ""something"" going on. I was entertained.</p>

<p>Perhaps if the producers of the movie would have given this $6 million to another screenwriter, 'Die Another Day' would have been a good James Bond film... but instead we are left with this video, that is clearly a set design rip-off of the next most expensive video ever made.</p>

<p>Michael Jackson is awesome. I have nothing bad to say about anything that he's ever done, and this video is as awesome now as it was when it came out; money well spent. One question though... why does Michael always flip off the camera in his videos?</p>

<p>Nintendo's new handheld system, the 3DS, hits the street this Sunday, March 27th in North America. At $249 MSRP -- the same price the Wii was when it came out -- it's no small investment. Maybe you've got your solid old DS Lite still kicking around (or if you're like me, you've got the fat old first generation DS still because you're a cheapskate and I mean who really NEEDS a decent backlight, right?), and you're wondering if upgrading to the 3DS is necessary.</p>

And it's an impressive effect. The level of 3D being displayed can also be adjusted on the fly with a slider, in case it's giving you a headache. <br /><br />- Existing DS hardware has been tightened up and improved in many ways.<br /><br />The graphics are greatly improved, the system is smaller and lighter, the top screen is about 10% bigger, and the controls are easier to use. Much adulation has surrounded the new ""Slide Pad"" controller, which is apparently really slick. The touchscreen, however, is unchanged; one might have hoped for better touchscreen sensitivity in the age of Apple, but no dice. Early reports also indicate that the battery life is depressingly low, but the 3DS's charge cradle is apparently awesome and supports play-and-charge.<br /><br />- It has three cameras -- two external, one internal.<br /><br />These cameras can be used to take photos and insert real life environmental factors into games, which is neat by itself -- but truly amazing is the fact that the Nintendo 3DS is also able to take 3D photos and videos. I have no idea how spectacular (or not) the quality is on these, but it could be a very cool feature to have in your hands. Additionally, it comes with 6 augmented reality cards (or AR cards) -- aim your camera at the cards in certain games to bring your real-life environment into the game. <br /><br />- The Nintendo 3DS has a gyroscope and accelerometer.<br /><br />Like the iPhone, you can tilt and turn your 3DS to control the action onscreen -- though not in every game. This seems like it has the potential to really clash with the 3D functionality -- but if it's an annoying feature, you can turn it off. (Can I just say, I LOVE the word gyroscope? Digression, but c'mon, it's so steampunk.) <br /><br />- The 3DS is backwards compatible. <br /><br />It'll play both regular DS and DSi games, as well as DSiWare and downloadable Game Boy Color titles through Nintendo's eShop.<br /><br />- Like the Wii, you'll be able to make Miis with your 3DS.<br /><br />Even cooler, you can use the 3DS's built-in camera to take a photo of your face and have your system attempt to render a Mii to look like you. You'll also be able to import your beloved Miis from your Wii.<br /><br />- The Nintendo 3DS has some pretty revolutionary new software.<br /><br />This is actually the biggest part of what I'm excited about for the 3DS. Street Pass, the name of one particular technology the 3DS uses, is a system that allows your 3DS to link to other 3DS's you pass on the street. You can choose to automatically share your Mii, profile, games, achievements, etc. <br /><br />Super Street Fighter 4 3D is a game that's using this technology in an interesting way: their Figure Battle Mode allows you to spend coins you earn in-game in a slot machine to buy random character figurines. You then use these figurines to build a team and assign stat points. Once you enter Street Pass mode (which I think activates just by putting the system to sleep), your Nintendo 3DS will automatically seek out other people who've done the same thing and enter battle with their teams.</p>

<p>A girl gets thrown into an insane asylum and together, with her fellow attractive inmates she must journey into to her subconscious to find an escape because &ldquo;reality is only a prison&rdquo;. Of course their subconscious is a fantasy world of action, adventure, gatling gun toting giant samurai and dragons. Like all of Snyder&rsquo;s work, it looks like a 90-minute video clip and a popcorn-munching good time. Here&rsquo;s the trailer:</p>
<p><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/KrIiYSdEe4E"" width=""560"" height=""349"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p>But it got me thinking. A person has a transformative experience and then exhibits superhuman powers and performs extra-human feats. Sounds like a superhero film, right? The only thing missing is the yellow spandex (or black leather). So what other films are a black pvc suit away from being a superhero film?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found five movies whose secret identities I&rsquo;m about to expose.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gonna be spoilers ahead, so if you haven&rsquo;t seen them, do so, then come on back.</p>
<p>1. DONNIE DARKO</p>
<p><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://www.impawards.com/2001/posters/donnie_darko_ver3.jpg"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""744"" /></p>
<p>TRANSFORMATIVE MOMENT: It&rsquo;s probably around the point that you start seeing a giant bunny rabbit in the mirror telling you to do bad things that you&rsquo;re a couple sandwiches short of a picnic:</p>
<p><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://img.listal.com/image/44137/600full-donnie-darko-poster.jpg"" alt="""" width=""450"" height=""659"" /></p>
<p><em>If you ever see this guy outside of your tv screen, please seek immediate help</em></p>
<p>SUPERPOWER: Ability to create wormholes and parallel timelines to deliver justice.</p>
<p>SUPERFEAT: Transports a jet engine back in time to kill himself. Not the best use of a superpower, but hey, it&rsquo;s not like he got an instruction manual.</p>
<p>REASON: Well before Jake Gyllenhaal hit the bench press for Prince of Persia, he was strutting the superpowers back in Donnie Darko. And in that instant, there was a disturbance in the Indie Force so great that a million art film nerds cried out as one and died.</p>
<p>Seriously. Listen to the commentary. Richard Kelly says that this is a superhero story about a guy who gets unconventional powers, which he doesn&rsquo;t know how to use, which eventually drives him insane.</p>
<p>Just like Richard Kelly&rsquo;s follow up film, Southland Tales did to the rest of us.</p>
<p>2. THE BOONDOCK SAINTS</p>
<p><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://www.killerfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/boondock_saints1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""450"" height=""679"" /></p>
<p>TRANSFORMATIVE MOMENT: After surviving a hit attempt by the Russian mafia, the brothers MacManus have the same visionary dream which is basically, summed up by a priest at the start of the film: &ldquo;But there is another kind of evil which we must fear most, and that is the indifference of good men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>SUPERPOWER: A pair of Bostonians so hard you&rsquo;d break your foot kicking them. &nbsp;And the ability to drop more f-bombs than the entire US airforce.</p>
<p><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v110/Rimfyre/The-Boondock-Saints.jpg"" alt="""" width=""480"" height=""272"" /></p>
<p><em>They could probably tea bag you to death.</em></p>
<p>SUPERFEAT: Killing dozens and dozens of bad guys where they exercise the Irish&rsquo;s signature good luck rather than the good management.</p>
<p>REASON: If, like Marvel comics, you concede that the Punisher is a superhero, well then so are the brothers MacManus of the Boondock Saints. A simultaneous shared vision, a renewed fanatical purpose, a team name and lots and lots of fantastic gunfire make up one of my top five films ever.</p>
<p>Just please, don&rsquo;t watch the sequel.</p>
<p>3. THE MATRIX</p>
<p><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://images.wikia.com/filmguide/images/a/a8/TheMatrix_poster.jpg"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""692"" /></p>
<p>TRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCE: Upon discovering that &ldquo;reality is only a prison&rdquo; &ndash; or actually a means to pacify the human race to use as batteries, Neo learns kung-fu (and every other way of bringing a hard bony part of your body to someone else&rsquo;s squishy parts) to liberate us from our robotic overlords.</p>
<p>SUPERPOWER: The ability to immediately do multiple martial arts, dodge and later stop bullets, super speed and fly. Seriously.</p>
<p>SUPERFEAT: He. Can. Fly. And. Stop. Bullets. In. Mid. Air = Super hero.</p>
<p>REASON: The Matrix is one big origin story for a superhero. Let&rsquo;s do this by the numbers:</p>
<p>Alter Ego name: Mr. Thomas Anderson/Neo.</p>
<p>Costume: big black coat/cape.</p>
<p>Catchy saying: Woah.</p>
<p>Sidekick: Trinity.</p>
<p>Oh and again. Please don&rsquo;t watch the sequels. Anything you imagine that could happen to Neo and Trinity is better than what actually happened.</p>
<p><img src=""http://img529.imageshack.us/img529/5562/matrixscreen1cropresize.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""225"" /></p>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s a lot easier to dodge them when they fly at you in slow motion.</em></p>
<p>4. RESIDENT EVIL 2</p>
<p><img src=""http://massivemessenger.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/resident-evil-apocalypse.jpg?w=440&amp;h=654"" alt="""" width=""440"" height=""653"" /></p>
<p>TRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCE: Alice (Milla Jovovich)&nbsp; gains superhuman powers when she was experimented on by the sinister Umbrella corporation.</p>
<p>SUPER POWERS: Speed, strength, agility, the ability to compete for hotness with Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) and later on, all sorts of crazy psychic powers.</p>
<p>SUPER FEATS: Flipping, bullet dodging, punching super strong dudes and later telekinesis and clairvoyance.</p>
<p>REASON: For no reason other than the need to create some &ldquo;action porn&rdquo;, Alice is given super powers to kill a city full of zombies. She helps people, has a weird sort of &ldquo;costume&rdquo; and has dropped any pretense of a surname.</p>
<p><img src=""http://www.zone-sf.com/images/resevilap2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""485"" height=""323"" /></p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m only keeping you alive until the hot chick from Heroes turns up.</em></p>
<p>5. FIGHT CLUB</p>
<p><img src=""http://www.impawards.com/1999/posters/fight_club_ver3.jpg"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""745"" /></p>
<p>TRANSFORMATIVE MOMENT: Blowing up your own apartment and destroying everything you ever owned or cared about. Subconsciously.</p>
<p>SUPER POWER: The ability to manifest superhuman levels of charisma to instigate change, anarchy and transform underground &ldquo;fight clubs&rdquo; into terrorist cells.</p>
<p>SUPER FEAT: Mobilizing people on a national basis to destroy every major bank in the US.</p>
<p>REASON:&nbsp; Tyler Durden&rsquo;s ability to wreak havoc and destroy just about anything catapults him well past superhero and instead he must go directly to jail and straight into super-villain, or anti-hero status. What other well-known superhero story do we know where a guy blacks out and wakes up to find that while he was asleep and his alter ego wreaked unimaginable havoc? Oh right, the Hulk.</p>
<p>And ironically they both have the same alter-ego: Edward Nortan. Ka-ChinG! You see what I did there?</p>
<p>And on a good day, Tyler Durden could give the Hulk a run for his money for sheer superhuman destructive power.</p>

<p>I know that we consider musicians ""celebrities"", but when a musician puts a movie star in their music video, that's something that can really boost the view count! This week on ""The Playlist"" I'm going to give you my 5 favorite music videos starring movie stars.</p>
<p>5. Elton John: I Want Love</p>
<p><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/ufbexgPyeJQ"" width=""580"" height=""465"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p>The future ""Iron Man"" is all that needs to be said for this video. So really, who was more psychic about the future of Robert Downey Jr.'s career; Elton John or Shane Black? I'm gonna credit Elton John for this one.</p>
<p>4. Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers - Mary Jane's Last Dance</p>
<p><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/aowSGxim_O8"" width=""580"" height=""465"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p>What more can you ask for than appearance by Vicki Vale, I mean Kim Bassinger, in anything... let alone, a Tom Petty music video. This one is a classic.</p>
<p>3. Jamie Foxx featuring T-Pain - Blame It</p>
<p><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/rfjtpp90lu8"" width=""580"" height=""465"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p>I guess, in theory, Jamie Foxx is a movie star, but he throws Ron Howard, Jake Gyllenhaal, Samuel L. Jackson and Forest Whitaker in this one, and has Hype Williams direct it... the only thing missing here is an appearance by Keanu Reeves.</p>
<p>2. Paul Simon - You Can Call Me Al</p>
<p><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/AsEjsIbWq88"" width=""580"" height=""465"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p>Maybe Elton John's video was a up-to-date version of this, where Chevy Chase is singing the song. This one is from a while back, and deserves mention. Enjoy!</p>
<p>1. Fatboy Slim - Weapon of Choice</p>
<p><iframe src=""http://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/xo751?width=580&amp;theme=slayer&amp;foreground=%23FF0000&amp;highlight=%23FFFFFF&amp;background=%23000000&amp;wmode=direct"" width=""580"" height=""474"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p>Some argue that this is the best music video ever made... and it very well could be. This is certainly the best celebrity driven music video ever made! Christopher Walken was already amazing, but this video puts him on a level that will be hard for any other actor to reach. Nice work!</p>
<p>Bonus - Paula Abdul - Rush Rush</p>
<p><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/yqyIaNWP0T0"" width=""580"" height=""465"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p>I can't say that I like this music video, but it gets honorable mention because it stars Keanu Reeves! That's pretty awesome.</p>","<p>The Playlist - Celebrity Driven Music Videos<br /> by <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/andydugan"" target=""_blank"">Andy Dugan</a></p>

<p>I guess, in theory, Jamie Foxx is a movie star, but he throws Ron Howard, Jake Gyllenhaal, Samuel L. Jackson and Forest Whitaker in this one, and has Hype Williams direct it... the only thing missing here is an appearance by Keanu Reeves.</p>
<p>2. Paul Simon - You Can Call Me Al</p>

<p>Maybe Elton John's video was a up-to-date version of this, where Chevy Chase is singing the song. This one is from a while back, and deserves mention. Enjoy!</p>
<p>1. Fatboy Slim - Weapon of Choice</p>

<p>Some argue that this is the best music video ever made... and it very well could be. This is certainly the best celebrity driven music video ever made! Christopher Walken was already amazing, but this video puts him on a level that will be hard for any other actor to reach. Nice work!</p>
<p>Bonus - Paula Abdul - Rush Rush</p>

<p>So for the last couple of months, I had seen some rumblings on Twitter and Facebook from some female friends and colleagues talking about ""how much fun they were having playing in the woods.""&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />I wondered why but then thought ""It's L.A. and they're up to something and I'm sure I'll see it soon.""<br /><br />And I was right. A WHOLE LOT of ladies (and a few gents) were indeed up to something and it's called ""ElfQuest: A Fan Imagining"", based on the 1978-2007 comic book series created by Wendy and Richard Pini. <br /><br />Sounds neat, right? Sounded neat to Paula Rhodes and Stephanie Thorpe, too; two well known and well respected names in the New Media world. These two ladies not only share an impressive list of credits between them as actors and producers; they also share a fierce, undying love of Elfquest that made them the successful, feisty women they are today.</p>

So after poking around the EQ official website and reading the first issue, it seems to go something like this: several tribes of elves (evolved from an earlier alien like species known as ""High Ones"") vs humans in a never-ending struggle to not only survive, but to coexist on the planet called Abode or ""World of Two Moons"".&nbsp; <br /><br />ENOUGH wizzle wazzle!

<p>There are a few games that define their many sequels numerically -- Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest come to mind. What makes each sequel successful is that they usually riff on the formula and give an exciting new gameplay and story direction. Each game is its own discrete entity. They share qualities, but they're still individuals.</p>
<p><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/TzEAkeHuPvU"" width=""580"" height=""356"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p>What makes Dynasty Warriors so amazing is that they have not troubled to do this at all.<br /><br />I haven't played a Dynasty Warriors game since a bit of 5 when it was first released, but I played the shit out of 2 through 4, especially 3 (my all-time favorite). Characteristics critical to a Dynasty Warriors game include:<br /><br />- Cheesy heavy metal music<br /><br />- Awkward English dubbing and melodramatic voice acting<br /><br />- Hilariously inaccurate portrayal of historical events<br /><br />- Fruity wizards with fans (very important)<br /><br />- Effortless, ridiculous, massive hack-n-slash combat (preferably with lots of flames and glowy shit)<br /><br />When you play a Dynasty Warriors game, you're not there for the story, or the history, or the characters' relationships to each other. You are there to relax, turn off your brain, and see if you can manage to tumble artfully into a crowd and kill a hundred dudes at once.<br /><br />What Omega Force, the developer, has done this time around is tried to make you care about the things that were usually too vague and poorly translated for you to care about them before. You choose one of the four major families -- Wu, Shu, Wei, and Jin -- to run through the campaign. The story is told in a much more compelling, accessible way through cutscenes and loading screen narration. When you play through Story Mode, unlike games past, your general is chosen for you depending on the level. Each level begins with your character in the base with the doors closed -- you can speak to many of the NPCs around you to get perspective on the level and the characters involved (not necessary, but a cool semi-RPG element that connects you to the story). There are also weapons dealers in the towns where you can buy new gear.</p>

Each character has their ideal weapon, or their EX weapon, which allows them a unique special attack. Most weapons also have a special ""seal"", which once unlocked can be applied to an empty slot on any other weapon. This new approach to weapons is pretty cool, but several characters share EX weapon types now instead of having totally unique ones as in the past, and the animations for those weapon attacks is identical between those characters. Kind of a visual bummer.<br /><br />Besides Story Mode, Dynasty Warriors 7 also has Conquest Mode. Previous DW games had a Free Mode that allowed you to replay any level with any general. Conquest Mode has unique maps that are character-specific, where an unlocked character can level up, gather items, and flesh out their story a little more. Conquest Mode is also where online co-op lives, although I couldn't get it to connect myself, but I'm hoping that gets ironed out in the coming weeks.</p>

From what I've read, the graphics have never quite caught up with the current run of consoles, and that's not the case with this installment: it looks great. The camera is still pretty frustrating, with a sticky tendency to focus on the ground somewhere in front of you rather than let you look around. They've added some platforming challenges in the maps, which is awkwardly executed and feels uncomfortable in context. They also removed the indicator which shows how the battle is swaying, which was always useful to me as a person who likes to get lost in the wilderness killing dudes while my base is being secretly assaulted. You're required to be much more attentive to mission points on the map.<br /><br />All in all, this is an extremely satisfying addition to the series. If you didn't love Dynasty Warriors before, it's definitely not going to change your mind -- but if you do like the series, or you can appreciate some seriously satisfying mindlessness, it may be exactly what you need.<br /><br />(Word of advice: don't pursue Lu Bu.)<br /><br />- Kate</p>","<p>Pop Games: Dynasty Warriors 7<br /> by <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/shegeekshow"" target=""_blank"">Kate Welch (She Geek Show)</a></p>

<p>I had the opportunity to see a sneak peak of the pilot episode of Starz' new series ""Camelot."" I think Starz made a really good play with ""Spartacus: Blood and Sand"" and then even made that franchise better with ""Gods of the Arena!""

<p>""In the wake of King Uther&rsquo;s (Sebastian Koch) sudden death, chaos threatens to engulf Britain. When the sorcerer Merlin (Joseph Fiennes) has visions of a dark future, he installs the young and impetuous Arthur (Jamie Campbell Bower), Uther&rsquo;s unknown son and heir, who has been raised from birth as a commoner. But Arthur&rsquo;s cold and ambitious half sister Morgan (Eva Green) will fight him to the bitter end, summoning unnatural forces to claim the crown in this epic battle for control. These are dark times indeed for the new king, with Guinevere (Tamsin Egerton) being the only shining light in Arthur&rsquo;s harsh world. Faced with profound moral decisions, and the challenge of uniting a kingdom broken by war and steeped in deception, Arthur will be tested beyond imagination.

Then, in the last minutes of this episode, he breaks through, and the conflict he encounters brings out another side of him. Joseph Fiennes does a good job portraying a young Merlin, with a plan to keep evil away from the Kingdom, and is definitely my favorite character on the show at this point. I will stick around, I have faith in the Starz network, but with HBO's ""Game of Thrones"" on the way, every new episode of ""Camelot"" must get better and better.

<p>Alex McMillan: Thank you very much for joining me today, Kate</p>
<p>Kate Welch : My pleasure, Alex!</p>
<p>AM: So, without further ado, let's get to our predicting!</p>
<p>KW : I've been exercising my clairvoyancey muscles for just this moment.</p>
<p><br />MMORPGs</p>
<p><img src=""http://www.mmocrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Guild-Wars-2-1982.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""400"" /><br /><br />AM: Recently,  RIFT, a new MMORPG has been released, and it's been getting a lot of  praise for doing things differently from the standard MMO. With games  like RIFT and Guild Wars 2, coming out and supposedly doing new and  original things, do you think any of them can catch up with the momentum  that World of Warcraft has, or is WoW now completely unstoppable?</p>
<p>KW: So  I should start this prediction with the disclaimer that I currently  work for ArenaNet developing Guild Wars 2, and that I am in no way an  official spokesperson for them, and all the opinions I express about the  MMO world are my own. Just to be clear.</p>
<p>There's  a big problem when one talks about ""catching up to WoW"", because as you  say, the momentum of it is pretty well established. There's inertia  there. Not only do they have a huge chunk of the population already  ensnared, but they've also had six and a half years on the market to  draw from. They've rebalanced, retuned, and added content countless  times.</p>
<p>They've  got a base. Coming out with a brand new game can be really tough in  that sense, because every MMO needs a little adjustment when it's  released. That's usually enough to totally kill a new MMO -- when  players start it up and it's not as polished as good ol' WoW, a great  majority tend to dismiss it out of hand, because it's easier and  comfortable to go back to Azeroth.</p>
<p>And  of course, if all you do is parrot WoW with different monsters and  different environments, you just simply won't win, because you're asking  players to recreate the experience they've spent so much time on in WoW  starting from nothing. Some people might like that, but most people,  given a choice between WoW with 40 days /played across their characters,  will choose WoW again.</p>
<p>So  the secret sauce, I'm convinced, is finding out what bugs WoW players  -- what makes them quit even if there's no temptation to play another  MMO for them at that time -- and fix that.</p>
<p>I  think that's what Guild Wars 2 and RIFT have both offered, and it's  exciting as hell to WoW veterans who are tired of that formula.</p>
<p><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/ldI3ypm1gHg"" width=""560"" height=""349"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p>AM: I  think for anyone who is creating an MMO it's a very difficult balancing  act. Especially as MMOs are a genre that completely relies on its  player-base, the number of people playing is integral to the gaming  experience. Like you say, you can't mimic WoW as then there's no  incentive to switch, but at the same time you really can't be too  different, otherwise there aren't enough people to play. Take the  unfortunate case of All-Points Bulletin (APB) last year, which got  completely shut down due to the lack of popularity. It was going for a  very different angle and just didn't have the lasting power. I  definitely think there is a way to take a large portion of WoW players,  but I don't think anyone's found it yet; like you say, a company needs  to find the gripes WoW players have, and make a game without them. I'm  really looking forward to Guild Wars 2 as a person who hasn't played  MMOs properly before, and I think that is the other key market people  making MMORPGs have to tap into, is that group of people who haven't  felt the urge to play an MMORPG before, they need to figure out what can  make that person want to play, while at the same time getting the  audience of people who already play MMORPGs. It's an extremely complex  problem with very little room for error.</p>
<p>KW : Yeah,  you're telling me! It's basically what I'm holding my head and groaning  about all day long at work. But there's a lot of people who are in your  same position -- intrigued by Guild Wars 2 because it's doing something  different.</p>
<p>AM: I  think nearly all MMOs suffer from growing pains in their initial  release period. I don't think that's something they'll ever be able to  get over, and that is one of those massive stumbling blocks games have. I  think for a true WoW-killer, you have to make a great game that has no  faults from day one, and that is a real challenge that I'm hoping Guild  Wars 2 will overcome.</p>
<p>KW: It  is important to be as flawless as possible if you're coming at a  behemoth like WoW, certainly, but no game is perfect -- including WoW!  Cataclysm was and still is riddled with bugs. When you have a concrete  release game that has no evolution to it, just a one-off $60 game you  buy on a console, you have to be much more focused on that. But the  scope of an MMO is such that you simply can't be perfect at first pass.  You're right, it's important. It's just tough to do it, and a lot of  people swear it off easily when those problems start cropping up.</p>
<p><br />DUKE NUKEM FOREVER</p>
<p><img src=""http://jedineka.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/duke_nukem_forever_wallpaper_1_jedineka.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""490"" /><br /><br />AM: So,  it's been known for some time now that Gearbox, the studio behind  Borderlands, has taken over the role of producing Duke Nukem Forever,  which has been vapourware for I believe about 14 years now. If Duke  Nukem proves a success, do you think we'll be seeing more old franchises  rise from the dead, or is this a rare thing to happen?</p>
<p>KW: Honestly,  I don't think it's going to inspire a trend -- and the reason why is  because it's been such an infamous hopeless case for so long! There's a  famous picture out there on the web of a guy who preordered it so long  ago that his receipt is brown from age. It became a joke in the  community, you know? Duke Nukem Forever was a metaphor for hopelessness.</p>
<p>Now  that it's actually coming out, and looks awesome, that's cause for  celebration -- but I don't think we'll see a revival. The generation of  young kids who are gaming these days probably have no idea who Duke  Nukem even is (which is fine, because I'm sure it's getting an M  rating), so it'd be hard to remarket a long-dead series like that. My  spidey sense says no on this prediction.</p>
<p>AM: I  mean, there are certainly some franchises I would like to see make a  comeback (Not as blast-from the past as Duke, but I need me some  Timesplitters 4) but I don't know if it's enough of a driving force to  bring something back just for the nostalgia factor. I really think DNF  is a special case, it's become sort of a cult thing in its own way, but  if it did really well, I think we may see studios at least talking more  about old franchises. Whether or not that leads to revivals, I don't  know, but I do think a lot of companies follow the successful trends,  which it is very possible Duke Nukem could inspire.</p>
<p><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/wVuuyRGB_BA"" width=""560"" height=""349"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p>KW: Studios  do tend to follow the money, haha. I just think that it would take just  as much energy to develop a captivating new IP as it would to reinvent  an old franchise and market it to the current generation -- but that's  just me. And don't believe for a moment that I wouldn't be SPRINTING out  the door to buy a new Ecco the Dolphin game.</p>
<p>AM: I  think if we do see revivals, they won't be well done. I think if a  studio is gonna release an older franchise just for the money, they're  not going to do it well. So, while a lot of us live in hope of that new  Ecco the Dolphin game, I pray it doesn't fall into the wrong hands.</p>
<p>KW: Amen.  Don't get me started on studios that make games just because of the  name tied to 'em... that's a whole article of Kate Welch ranting her  brain out right there.</p>
<p>AM: If I set off the Kate Welch-rant trigger here, I doubt I'll be able to stop it :L</p>
<p>KW: I can nerd rage for days.</p>
<p>AM: One  thing that really made me hopeful of Duke Nukem Forever is that Randy  Pitchford (Head of Gearbox) says that he ""needs this as a gamer"". I  honestly believe he's doing it from the angle of a gamer, rather than  that of a businessman.</p>
<p>KW: Oh agreed. At this point, DNF is a labor of love. After all this time... hats off to Gearbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CALL OF DUTY</p>
<p><img src=""http://www.goozernation.com/video-games/images/stories/cod-black-ops.png"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""300"" /><br /><br />AM: And  on that optimistic note, we'll move onto our next hot topic: Call of  Duty, the unstoppable FPS train. So, there's been a countdown timer  supposedly for the next Modern Warfare game. Now whether or not it is  for Modern Warfare 3, as far as we know, there are about three Call of  Duty games being worked on at the moment. The time between CoD titles is  getting smaller and smaller, do you think it's going to continue to  shrink, and do you think this will affect the games in any way?</p>
<p>KW: I  think this is a question with a complex answer. Activision is getting a  lot of bad press lately. There was a big breakdown of how they managed  to gut the Guitar Hero series, and they're the first to bump their PC  games up to $60 to match console prices. So it's kind of hard to answer  this question without thinking it's them being somewhat evil.</p>
<p>But  I think it just comes down to dollars and cents, sadly. Call of Duty  games are consistently #1 on the sales charts when they release. It's a  matter of brand loyalty; people will always go buy a Call of Duty game  because they are consistently impressive, but also because they know all  their friends are going to be playing it too.</p>
<p>If  the window shrinks any more than it currently stands right now, it'll  be amazing -- I can't imagine developing a quality title for multiple  platforms in less than a year, but that's exactly what they're doing. If  they continue to whittle that window down, you'll definitely see a dip  in quality and a spike in DLC offerings. It's all a balancing act -- you  can't have it good, cheap, AND fast.</p>
<p>AM: I  think it's only now that the window between titles has become really  noticable, I mean, if we are getting a new one announced soon, that'll  be about a three/four month gap between last release and latest  announcement. I mean, as you say, you can't keep the quality up and  continue to decrease the time they have to make it, so I think  Activision have changed their strategy. I mean, obviously</p>
<p>they've  been having Infinity Ward and Treyarch rotate throughout the past  couple of years, but now they've also apparently got Raven working on a  CoD title, and then they're apparently making a game about Ghost, and on  top of that you hear about them making a Call of Duty game for the NGP.  They seem to be biting a lot off, and if they want to keep the quality  standards up I think they need to pace themselves.</p>
<p>KW: Totally  agreed. They look at Call of Duty and see a cash cow and they're  milking it ferociously. Which, I mean, if it works out, good for them. I  feel a little disdainful because FPS games are never my favorites -- I  suck at 'em. So I don't get the hype. But millions of other people do,  clearly.</p>
<p><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/gyASw-1KWyU"" width=""560"" height=""349"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p>AM: I've  always liked FPS's but not more-so than other genres, and cetainly Call  of Duty has never been a clear favourite, I usually prefer games that  do things sort of differently. I reckon it just comes down to ""My friend  has CoD, so if I get CoD we can play CoD together!"". And Activision can  say it's because they produce the best shooters, but no matter how they  spin it, it comes down to having a lot of people playing, and people  wanting to play together.</p>
<p>KW: Yep -- and each person has to buy a copy in order to play! Cha-ching!</p>
<p>AM: I mean, you can't really blame Activision for liking money, can you?</p>
<p>KW: No, I can't. We have that in common, Activision and I.</p>
<p><br />SUPERHEROES IN GAMES</p>
<p><img src=""http://www.gamesonsmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Batman-Arkham_City_Batman-Harley.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""300"" /><br /><br />AM: So,  we move on swiftly like a greased leopard to a subject I'm sure you'll  be able to discuss eternally, Batman (and other superheroes). Arkham  City is coming soon and is looking fabulous, and we're seeing a lot of  games about Superheroes being announced, most recently we had Thor: God  of Thunder announced at the VGAs. Do you think we'll be seeing more  characters leaping from the comic book to the console, and do you think  they will fall victim to being cash-ins?</p>
<p>KW: Short answer: definitely.</p>
<p>Making  movie spin-off games isn't a new phenomenon at all, so we'll likely be  getting the Thor and Captain America and Green Lantern video games  coming out alongside their movie counterparts. Then, of course, you have  games like Arkham Asylum and Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions that  didn't have a direct movie correlation; it's my belief that, like the  films, these games are a way for Marvel and DC to start making revenue  again. It's no secret that the comic book industry has been down on its  luck when it comes to people buying comics themselves, but people are  voracious about consuming those characters as movies and video games.  That's not going to change, I don't think.</p>
<p><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/qptrQ6TxzBQ"" width=""560"" height=""349"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p>There's  an upswing in comics readership that's happened since the advent of the  iPad and the comic reader/store apps that came along with it. Which is  AWESOME, of course. But if anything, I think that introducing these  comics to an audience that may never have though to purchase them as  individual issues will only increase the interest in seeing those  characters in other media forms. Now, whether those games will be any  good...</p>
<p>I  mean, Arkham Asylum ruled. Shattered Dimensions seemed awesome in  concept, but lacked in execution. There aren't many other superhero  video games that you can point to and say ""they did it right."" It's a  very tough thing to do. Games are mechanical and often lack the grace  you want to impart to a character on-screen or in a comic book.</p>
<p>So  I don't have the highest hopes in terms of quality -- but I'm always on  board to see a character show up in its own video game. Will I buy  Thor: God of Thunder? Most def. And that's all they want from me anyway.</p>
<p><br />THE YEAR OF THE SEQUEL</p>
<p><img src=""http://www.gearsofwar3info.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Gears-of-War-3-Release-Date.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""320"" /><br /><br />AM: So,  we move to our final future-telling of the day, and it is on the  subject of sequels. This year we could see more game sequels than ever  before, with some of the biggest releases of the year announced so far  being Uncharted 3, Portal 2, Mass Effect 3, Killzone 3 and Gears of War  3. Do you think in the years to come we'll be seeing more sequels, or  are we going to start seeing more original IPs?</p>
<p>KW: 2011  is definitely the year of the sequel. When I did my episode about top  five mainstream games, I was making a list of every game I was excited  about this year and I think maybe two out of 10 of them were original  IPs.</p>
<p>But  I don't think that is anything to be concerned about. Every sequel that  you just named, and a handful of others I can think of, is massively  exciting -- because the properties are totally awesome. Maybe you can  call it uncreative to just continue the formula that made you successful  and popular the first time around, but I don't think it's such a bad  thing. If people want to play another game -- if your community has been  demanding a sequel, pounding down your door for one -- and you are  excited to do it, I think that's a win/win situation.</p>
<p>I  find it really interesting when an original IP comes along in a sea of  sequels -- like LA Noire, for instance. It tends to stand out more. It's  much easier and more comfortable to gamble on a sure thing.</p>
<p>Will  we see more Years of the Sequels in the future? Probably so. There was  an article I read recently about how game devs should appreciate their  pirates and treat them as future paying customers -- let them pirate  your first game, give them great support, and they're more likely to  convert when you develop a sequel.</p>
<p>Not IF you develop a sequel -- but WHEN.</p>
<p>And  game piracy is so rampant that it's just a fact that you have to figure  out how you're going to deal with them, not worry whether you'll have  to. So if you release Mass Effect 1, and half the people who play it  pirate it and like it, you're more likely to have some of those pirates  buy Mass Effect 2, and more who will buy Mass Effect 3.</p>
<p>So  yeah, sequels are going to keep coming out. It sort of stinks if you  don't like any of the current offerings, but most people are excited, I  think. And if you hate 'em, there's always the luscious world of indie  gaming that's calling to you.</p>
<p><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/DHHcM6aHPnE"" width=""560"" height=""349"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p>AM: I  think a lot of people see sequels as lazy, and in some cases it's true,  but nowadays, it's just good business. People liked Dead Space, that's  why we got Dead Space 2. People wanted another Portal, so we're getting  Portal 2. It's serving to the general population of gamers, certainly,  but if a game is good, people are going to want more, so more sequels  could be seen as a blessing and a curse as you say, there is no lack of  creativity and innovation, especially in the indie game market. I mean,  take breakthrough hit Minecraft for example.</p>
<p>KW: Yeah, that's a great example. Minecraft has been a phenomenon.</p>
<p>I  don't think too many of the sequels on track for this year are being  developed ""just because"" or anything. I think there was huge demand, and  the studios are trying to satisfy that demand.</p>
<p>AM: Kate, I'd like to thank you for taking the time today to predict the future with me</p>
<p>KW: Of course! I also predict that this interview will be a huge hit.</p>
<p>AM: That's very kind of you to say, it's been an absolute pleasure.</p>

Whether or not that leads to revivals, I don't  know, but I do think a lot of companies follow the successful trends,  which it is very possible Duke Nukem could inspire.</p>
<p><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/wVuuyRGB_BA"" width=""560"" height=""349"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p>KW: Studios  do tend to follow the money, haha. I just think that it would take just  as much energy to develop a captivating new IP as it would to reinvent  an old franchise and market it to the current generation -- but that's  just me. And don't believe for a moment that I wouldn't be SPRINTING out  the door to buy a new Ecco the Dolphin game.</p>
<p>AM: I  think if we do see revivals, they won't be well done. I think if a  studio is gonna release an older franchise just for the money, they're  not going to do it well. So, while a lot of us live in hope of that new  Ecco the Dolphin game, I pray it doesn't fall into the wrong hands.</p>
<p>KW: Amen.  Don't get me started on studios that make games just because of the  name tied to 'em... that's a whole article of Kate Welch ranting her  brain out right there.</p>
<p>AM: If I set off the Kate Welch-rant trigger here, I doubt I'll be able to stop it :L</p>
<p>KW: I can nerd rage for days.</p>
<p>AM: One  thing that really made me hopeful of Duke Nukem Forever is that Randy  Pitchford (Head of Gearbox) says that he ""needs this as a gamer"". I  honestly believe he's doing it from the angle of a gamer, rather than  that of a businessman.</p>
<p>KW: Oh agreed. At this point, DNF is a labor of love. After all this time... hats off to Gearbox.</p>

<p>CALL OF DUTY</p>
<p><img src=""http://www.goozernation.com/video-games/images/stories/cod-black-ops.png"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""300"" /><br /><br />AM: And  on that optimistic note, we'll move onto our next hot topic: Call of  Duty, the unstoppable FPS train. So, there's been a countdown timer  supposedly for the next Modern Warfare game. Now whether or not it is  for Modern Warfare 3, as far as we know, there are about three Call of  Duty games being worked on at the moment. The time between CoD titles is  getting smaller and smaller, do you think it's going to continue to  shrink, and do you think this will affect the games in any way?</p>
<p>KW: I  think this is a question with a complex answer. Activision is getting a  lot of bad press lately. There was a big breakdown of how they managed  to gut the Guitar Hero series, and they're the first to bump their PC  games up to $60 to match console prices. So it's kind of hard to answer  this question without thinking it's them being somewhat evil.</p>
<p>But  I think it just comes down to dollars and cents, sadly. Call of Duty  games are consistently #1 on the sales charts when they release. It's a  matter of brand loyalty; people will always go buy a Call of Duty game  because they are consistently impressive, but also because they know all  their friends are going to be playing it too.</p>
<p>If  the window shrinks any more than it currently stands right now, it'll  be amazing -- I can't imagine developing a quality title for multiple  platforms in less than a year, but that's exactly what they're doing. If  they continue to whittle that window down, you'll definitely see a dip  in quality and a spike in DLC offerings. It's all a balancing act -- you  can't have it good, cheap, AND fast.</p>
<p>AM: I  think it's only now that the window between titles has become really  noticable, I mean, if we are getting a new one announced soon, that'll  be about a three/four month gap between last release and latest  announcement. I mean, as you say, you can't keep the quality up and  continue to decrease the time they have to make it, so I think  Activision have changed their strategy. I mean, obviously</p>
<p>they've  been having Infinity Ward and Treyarch rotate throughout the past  couple of years, but now they've also apparently got Raven working on a  CoD title, and then they're apparently making a game about Ghost, and on  top of that you hear about them making a Call of Duty game for the NGP.  They seem to be biting a lot off, and if they want to keep the quality  standards up I think they need to pace themselves.</p>
<p>KW: Totally  agreed. They look at Call of Duty and see a cash cow and they're  milking it ferociously. Which, I mean, if it works out, good for them. I  feel a little disdainful because FPS games are never my favorites -- I  suck at 'em. So I don't get the hype. But millions of other people do,  clearly.</p>
<p><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/gyASw-1KWyU"" width=""560"" height=""349"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p>AM: I've  always liked FPS's but not more-so than other genres, and cetainly Call  of Duty has never been a clear favourite, I usually prefer games that  do things sort of differently. I reckon it just comes down to ""My friend  has CoD, so if I get CoD we can play CoD together!"". And Activision can  say it's because they produce the best shooters, but no matter how they  spin it, it comes down to having a lot of people playing, and people  wanting to play together.</p>
<p>KW: Yep -- and each person has to buy a copy in order to play! Cha-ching!</p>
<p>AM: I mean, you can't really blame Activision for liking money, can you?</p>
<p>KW: No, I can't. We have that in common, Activision and I.</p>
<p><br />SUPERHEROES IN GAMES</p>
<p><img src=""http://www.gamesonsmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Batman-Arkham_City_Batman-Harley.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""300"" /><br /><br />AM: So,  we move on swiftly like a greased leopard to a subject I'm sure you'll  be able to discuss eternally, Batman (and other superheroes). Arkham  City is coming soon and is looking fabulous, and we're seeing a lot of  games about Superheroes being announced, most recently we had Thor: God  of Thunder announced at the VGAs. Do you think we'll be seeing more  characters leaping from the comic book to the console, and do you think  they will fall victim to being cash-ins?</p>
<p>KW: Short answer: definitely.</p>
<p>Making  movie spin-off games isn't a new phenomenon at all, so we'll likely be  getting the Thor and Captain America and Green Lantern video games  coming out alongside their movie counterparts. Then, of course, you have  games like Arkham Asylum and Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions that  didn't have a direct movie correlation; it's my belief that, like the  films, these games are a way for Marvel and DC to start making revenue  again. It's no secret that the comic book industry has been down on its  luck when it comes to people buying comics themselves, but people are  voracious about consuming those characters as movies and video games.  That's not going to change, I don't think.</p>
<p><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/qptrQ6TxzBQ"" width=""560"" height=""349"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p>There's  an upswing in comics readership that's happened since the advent of the  iPad and the comic reader/store apps that came along with it. Which is  AWESOME, of course. But if anything, I think that introducing these  comics to an audience that may never have though to purchase them as  individual issues will only increase the interest in seeing those  characters in other media forms. Now, whether those games will be any  good...</p>
<p>I  mean, Arkham Asylum ruled. Shattered Dimensions seemed awesome in  concept, but lacked in execution. There aren't many other superhero  video games that you can point to and say ""they did it right."" It's a  very tough thing to do. Games are mechanical and often lack the grace  you want to impart to a character on-screen or in a comic book.</p>
<p>So  I don't have the highest hopes in terms of quality -- but I'm always on  board to see a character show up in its own video game. Will I buy  Thor: God of Thunder? Most def. And that's all they want from me anyway.</p>
<p><br />THE YEAR OF THE SEQUEL</p>
<p><img src=""http://www.gearsofwar3info.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Gears-of-War-3-Release-Date.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""320"" /><br /><br />AM: So,  we move to our final future-telling of the day, and it is on the  subject of sequels. This year we could see more game sequels than ever  before, with some of the biggest releases of the year announced so far  being Uncharted 3, Portal 2, Mass Effect 3, Killzone 3 and Gears of War  3. Do you think in the years to come we'll be seeing more sequels, or  are we going to start seeing more original IPs?</p>
<p>KW: 2011  is definitely the year of the sequel. When I did my episode about top  five mainstream games, I was making a list of every game I was excited  about this year and I think maybe two out of 10 of them were original  IPs.</p>
<p>But  I don't think that is anything to be concerned about. Every sequel that  you just named, and a handful of others I can think of, is massively  exciting -- because the properties are totally awesome. Maybe you can  call it uncreative to just continue the formula that made you successful  and popular the first time around, but I don't think it's such a bad  thing. If people want to play another game -- if your community has been  demanding a sequel, pounding down your door for one -- and you are  excited to do it, I think that's a win/win situation.</p>
<p>I  find it really interesting when an original IP comes along in a sea of  sequels -- like LA Noire, for instance. It tends to stand out more. It's  much easier and more comfortable to gamble on a sure thing.</p>
<p>Will  we see more Years of the Sequels in the future? Probably so. There was  an article I read recently about how game devs should appreciate their  pirates and treat them as future paying customers -- let them pirate  your first game, give them great support, and they're more likely to  convert when you develop a sequel.</p>
<p>Not IF you develop a sequel -- but WHEN.</p>
<p>And  game piracy is so rampant that it's just a fact that you have to figure  out how you're going to deal with them, not worry whether you'll have  to. So if you release Mass Effect 1, and half the people who play it  pirate it and like it, you're more likely to have some of those pirates  buy Mass Effect 2, and more who will buy Mass Effect 3.</p>
<p>So  yeah, sequels are going to keep coming out. It sort of stinks if you  don't like any of the current offerings, but most people are excited, I  think. And if you hate 'em, there's always the luscious world of indie  gaming that's calling to you.</p>
<p><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/DHHcM6aHPnE"" width=""560"" height=""349"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p>AM: I  think a lot of people see sequels as lazy, and in some cases it's true,  but nowadays, it's just good business. People liked Dead Space, that's  why we got Dead Space 2. People wanted another Portal, so we're getting  Portal 2. It's serving to the general population of gamers, certainly,  but if a game is good, people are going to want more, so more sequels  could be seen as a blessing and a curse as you say, there is no lack of  creativity and innovation, especially in the indie game market. I mean,  take breakthrough hit Minecraft for example.</p>
<p>KW: Yeah, that's a great example. Minecraft has been a phenomenon.</p>
<p>I  don't think too many of the sequels on track for this year are being  developed ""just because"" or anything. I think there was huge demand, and  the studios are trying to satisfy that demand.</p>
<p>AM: Kate, I'd like to thank you for taking the time today to predict the future with me</p>
<p>KW: Of course! I also predict that this interview will be a huge hit.</p>
<p>AM: That's very kind of you to say, it's been an absolute pleasure.</p>
<p>KW: The pleasure is all mine! Thanks Alex!</p>

Mjolnir  bears the inscription, &ldquo;Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.""<br /> <br />Mjolnir appears in a crater after the credits of Iron Man 2.</p>

<p>2. The Avengers movie is currently being directed by Joss Whedon.  Thor is the most powerful (and strongest) founding member of The  Avengers, a group of Marvel&rsquo;s superheroes founded by Iron Man (Robert  Downey Jr), Captain America (Chris Evans), The Hulk (Mark Ruffallo), Ant  Man and the Wasp.<br /><br /><img src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/X0K_9J1n4pE939KvU3atrClxMABKdes9DsAUR3ixjbItZP91bawOPpuqvqrnTnJAOWNs9mo_75wnPYgalGJy8mIeZyQjg-qo4We1BNV-0TxMjJU6H_g"" alt="""" width=""570"" height=""330"" /><br /> <br />3. Others who have wielded Mjolnir include Beta Ray Bill, Eric  Masterson (Thunderstrike), Steve Rogers (Captain America) and Wonder  Woman.<br /><br /><img src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/CN6qMNOgSghghhnt_OTjpiQVox0WLgoFsKvEexQjD0UPpQ-Hr7M_8xEVVdhnHLhNPA7ROvnFf-olZlvLDsTD1HEz8jTsy5BPV_6FBzkFpzb5H5giEBs"" alt="""" width=""570;"" height=""585"" /><br /><br />4. In comics, Thor was trapped inside the body of partially disabled  medical student Donald Blake and Jane Foster was his nurse. When he  slammed his cane on the ground, he transformed into the god of Thunder.  Donald Blake is only used as Thor&rsquo;s human name in the film.<br /><br /><img src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/qdUhmlTbhk1ROvvrX7Dp5L-On1LusKTNXwbmzOOj_lYGlMhXRukMMRO-VtrtLGgR7c14bVwtAO4O2Pa7BPFWTHU93zssFn_l8A-DtHCfiQFMoKlY-3k"" alt="""" width=""570"" height=""409"" /><br /><br />5. Thor was successfully rebooted as an activist hippie in the  spectacular The Ultimates (2002). In this story, it&rsquo;s speculated that it  is more likely that Thor is a delusional super-powered guy who&rsquo;s had a  nervous breakdown than a god of thunder.<br /><br /><img src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/eYCyjSZi6Q4IzX-R0UX8a5OT7s1wUqHGVKipI5H6dwtBdaVHpOzboZKX8ykbe9jYy4Z_fmTQf8TfjPQoDBX089LcmUHVbFLlfQB9uyR8G1tT4_uf_g0"" alt="""" width=""570"" height=""520"" /><br /><br />THOR'S POWERS<br /><br />1. Thor is a god. He&rsquo;s immortal and has been beating up Fire and Frost giants for centuries. That means he&rsquo;s the last person even Wolverine ever wants to fight with.<br />2. He&rsquo;s the strongest hero in the Marvel universe. Only the Hulk with a rage on gets stronger.<br />3. Being uniquely worthy to wield Mjolnir (his hammer) allows Thor to summon storms, spin it to create impenetrable barriers and flight. When Mjolnir is thrown to cave in some supervillain&rsquo;s head, it will always return to his hand</p>

Thor is the most powerful (and strongest) founding member of The  Avengers, a group of Marvel&rsquo;s superheroes founded by Iron Man (Robert  Downey Jr), Captain America (Chris Evans), The Hulk (Mark Ruffallo), Ant  Man and the Wasp.<br /><br /><img src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/X0K_9J1n4pE939KvU3atrClxMABKdes9DsAUR3ixjbItZP91bawOPpuqvqrnTnJAOWNs9mo_75wnPYgalGJy8mIeZyQjg-qo4We1BNV-0TxMjJU6H_g"" alt="""" width=""570"" height=""330"" /><br /> <br />3.

In comics, Thor was trapped inside the body of partially disabled  medical student Donald Blake and Jane Foster was his nurse. When he  slammed his cane on the ground, he transformed into the god of Thunder.  Donald Blake is only used as Thor&rsquo;s human name in the film.<br /><br /><img src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/qdUhmlTbhk1ROvvrX7Dp5L-On1LusKTNXwbmzOOj_lYGlMhXRukMMRO-VtrtLGgR7c14bVwtAO4O2Pa7BPFWTHU93zssFn_l8A-DtHCfiQFMoKlY-3k"" alt="""" width=""570"" height=""409"" /><br /><br />5. Thor was successfully rebooted as an activist hippie in the  spectacular The Ultimates (2002). In this story, it&rsquo;s speculated that it  is more likely that Thor is a delusional super-powered guy who&rsquo;s had a  nervous breakdown than a god of thunder.<br /><br /><img src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/eYCyjSZi6Q4IzX-R0UX8a5OT7s1wUqHGVKipI5H6dwtBdaVHpOzboZKX8ykbe9jYy4Z_fmTQf8TfjPQoDBX089LcmUHVbFLlfQB9uyR8G1tT4_uf_g0"" alt="""" width=""570"" height=""520"" /><br /><br />THOR'S POWERS<br /><br />1. Thor is a god. He&rsquo;s immortal and has been beating up Fire and Frost giants for centuries. That means he&rsquo;s the last person even Wolverine ever wants to fight with.<br />2. He&rsquo;s the strongest hero in the Marvel universe. Only the Hulk with a rage on gets stronger.<br />3. Being uniquely worthy to wield Mjolnir (his hammer) allows Thor to summon storms, spin it to create impenetrable barriers and flight. When Mjolnir is thrown to cave in some supervillain&rsquo;s head, it will always return to his hand</p>

<p>Since Kinect's widely-marketed launch last holiday season, the landscape of Kinect games has been kinda dismal. The Kinect is cool and has really interesting potential (as many excellent Youtube videos of Kinect hacks have shown us), but so far there hasn't been much that's creatively and effectively utilizing the tech.<br /><br />So today, I'm going to review for you a game that launched with Kinect and is still its best offering: Dance Central from Harmonix.<br /><br />Harmonix does a lot of things well. They know how to capture the tone of a particular phenomenon and express it through design. Rock Band and Guitar Hero made you feel like an ultra cool rock star, even though you were playing on a dorky little plastic game peripheral. Dance Central has continued this trend through design and interface, capturing the glamour and glitz of the nightclub scene.<br /><br />Let me pause here and draw your attention to that last bit: the ""nightclub scene"" is not one I frequent. I think I've been to a nightclub once, and I think it was '80s night, so it's not representative of the same club culture that you'll find in Dance Central. About half the songs in the playlist were new to me, and frankly, I found them to be kind of a turnoff. When Guitar Hero came out, I was still pretty young and it introduced me to a lot of great, must-hear music that had passed me by. This is not the case with Dance Central. <br /><br />That said, they are a hell of a lot of fun to dance to.</p>
<p><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/dkRiHMXq6nw"" width=""579"" height=""356"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p>The gameplay is exactly what you would expect: a kookily-dressed character dances on screen, you dance the same way, and the closer you match what they do, the higher your score. It starts out easy with some Gaga and M.I.A., but by the time you're in the third tier, you are sweating bullets. Dance Central is a good goddamn workout. (There's even a workout mode, where you enter your weight and it tracks your calories and time. Love it.)<br /><br />There are a couple downfalls to this game. One, although the game encourages you to get up and join your friends as a ""backup dancer"", your backup moves aren't tracked by the Kinect's sensors, so it's really just for fun and not for points. What this means (in my experience so far, anyway) is that you end up taking turns with friends playing Dance Central, which is sort of embarrassing for someone like me, a master of the awkward flail. There's a dance battle mode where you can compete on the same song for the higher score, but -- eh. This needs multiplayer support or real-time dance battles. Anything else is just a glorified way of handing off the controller. <br /><br />Things I've learned by playing Dance Central so far: one, I absolutely rule at Maneater; and two, I absolutely suck at all hip hop dance moves. I'll get you yet, Soulja Boy.<br /><br />- Kate</p>","<p>Pop Games: Dance Central<br /> by <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/shegeekshow"" target=""_blank"">Kate Welch (She Geek Show)</a></p>

Nothing like we saw back in the Silver Age with ""Sgt. Rock,"" ""Sgt. Fury"" and ""The Unknown Soldier,"" (just to name a few) but there is something about WWII that brings out the inner patriot in all of us.</p>
<p><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/mNhT0cG1OHQ"" width=""579"" height=""356"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p>WWII was unique for America; we knew our enemy and had a unified cause as a nation, the fight for freedom across the globe. Everyone understood why we were fighting and everyone stood behind the soldiers. Regardless of your beliefs on war, you can&rsquo;t deny the entire nation had a sense of &lsquo;duty and patriotism&rsquo; during WWII which hasn&rsquo;t been seen since. With so much controversy surrounding our current military actions, it&rsquo;s nice to think about a time when war was more &lsquo;black and white&rsquo;. <br /><br />Here are some other more recent war comics to get your patriotic juices flowing:<br /><br />1)&nbsp; Battlefields - Created and Written by Garth Ennis, this series brings to light lesser-known stories and conflicts of WWII.&nbsp; Ennis focuses on the extraordinary stories of relatively ordinary soldiers. Not Super Soldiers or Special Forces, but people that battled against all odds to overcome unimaginable tasks. Ennis is no stranger to war fiction from his other series (War Story, Unknown Soldier, Adventures of the Rifle Brigade) and really brings his A-game to this series.</p>
<p><img src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uGkf3ZGZk7t4V8fdbjbgHY3zNdJLV9Es_EQm3PYV5JbZglAKP2eIrpou1tN7_8dQO-3d_PR2xBGsXuxT78FamHM7AUBI66MD_WEvh--7SwTuNh3FpVo"" alt="""" width=""300px;"" height=""450px;"" /></p>
<p>2) I Am Legion - The long awaited hardcover edition of Humanoids came out last year and was worth the wait. This series brings a supernatural take on World War II as the Nazis search for a girl with the ability to posses other bodies. The artwork of superstar artist John Cassaday (Astonishing X-Men and Planetary) is beautiful and the roller coaster story will keep you reading.<br /><br /><img src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/E-Tx0HDiCvkGcLrSAVvPDl6o8sRQAGKmzSFNfWINx0NFgDqw_UTo7Paq-y_ZMBkr5z3ij_DEQTiz7B28mQ9fgAEvWyDR7UafHPaga5bfgslCbqLdrz8"" alt="""" width=""339px;"" height=""514px;"" /><br /><br />3) America&rsquo;s Army - This graphic novel is based on the video game of the same name and focuses on the storyline behind the game. One of my favorite parts of this series is actually not the comic itself, but the motion comic that was produced as part of this series. They definitely did their research and the production value is pretty high. The strong voice overs and great sound design really pull you in. Both the graphic novel and motion comics are available for free on the game&rsquo;s website. <a href=""http://www.americasarmy.com/graphicnovel/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.americasarmy.com/graphicnovel/<br /></a><br /><img src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/h4sVnKlTA-j_-pUXLyj9dRO84A4seRsFWRcwEFjZHzmFgUQ6c06U25bo1v11NXYSHPtbRxCjhvZ8frAT0abqkAf4Pjt-Bn9igqFWs7xo8uFFXnVKsxM"" alt="""" width=""382px;"" height=""569px;"" /><br /><br />4) The Other Side - This series set in the Vietnam war tells parallel stories of an American solider and a VC soldier fighting for their respective countries. Both characters struggle to deal with the horrors of war and how it affects their soul and sanity. Jason Aaron does an amazing job capturing the tone of this war and really brings the human element to an inhumane setting.</p>

In the Philippines a new hero named Ameer, a mixture of Batman and Zorro, is fighting terrorists across the Sulu islands which were once a terrorist safe haven.

Nothing like we saw back in the Silver Age with ""Sgt. Rock,"" ""Sgt. Fury"" and ""The Unknown Soldier,"" (just to name a few) but there is something about WWII that brings out the inner patriot in all of us.</p>
<p><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/mNhT0cG1OHQ"" width=""579"" height=""356"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p>WWII was unique for America; we knew our enemy and had a unified cause as a nation, the fight for freedom across the globe. Everyone understood why we were fighting and everyone stood behind the soldiers. Regardless of your beliefs on war, you can&rsquo;t deny the entire nation had a sense of &lsquo;duty and patriotism&rsquo; during WWII which hasn&rsquo;t been seen since. With so much controversy surrounding our current military actions, it&rsquo;s nice to think about a time when war was more &lsquo;black and white&rsquo;. <br /><br />Here are some other more recent war comics to get your patriotic juices flowing:<br /><br />1)&nbsp; Battlefields - Created and Written by Garth Ennis, this series brings to light lesser-known stories and conflicts of WWII.&nbsp; Ennis focuses on the extraordinary stories of relatively ordinary soldiers. Not Super Soldiers or Special Forces, but people that battled against all odds to overcome unimaginable tasks. Ennis is no stranger to war fiction from his other series (War Story, Unknown Soldier, Adventures of the Rifle Brigade) and really brings his A-game to this series.</p>

<p>2) I Am Legion - The long awaited hardcover edition of Humanoids came out last year and was worth the wait. This series brings a supernatural take on World War II as the Nazis search for a girl with the ability to posses other bodies. The artwork of superstar artist John Cassaday (Astonishing X-Men and Planetary) is beautiful and the roller coaster story will keep you reading.<br /><br /><img src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/E-Tx0HDiCvkGcLrSAVvPDl6o8sRQAGKmzSFNfWINx0NFgDqw_UTo7Paq-y_ZMBkr5z3ij_DEQTiz7B28mQ9fgAEvWyDR7UafHPaga5bfgslCbqLdrz8"" alt="""" width=""339px;"" height=""514px;"" /><br /><br />3) America&rsquo;s Army - This graphic novel is based on the video game of the same name and focuses on the storyline behind the game. One of my favorite parts of this series is actually not the comic itself, but the motion comic that was produced as part of this series. They definitely did their research and the production value is pretty high. The strong voice overs and great sound design really pull you in. Both the graphic novel and motion comics are available for free on the game&rsquo;s website. <a href=""http://www.americasarmy.com/graphicnovel/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.americasarmy.com/graphicnovel/<br /></a><br /><img src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/h4sVnKlTA-j_-pUXLyj9dRO84A4seRsFWRcwEFjZHzmFgUQ6c06U25bo1v11NXYSHPtbRxCjhvZ8frAT0abqkAf4Pjt-Bn9igqFWs7xo8uFFXnVKsxM"" alt="""" width=""382px;"" height=""569px;"" /><br /><br />4) The Other Side - This series set in the Vietnam war tells parallel stories of an American solider and a VC soldier fighting for their respective countries. Both characters struggle to deal with the horrors of war and how it affects their soul and sanity. Jason Aaron does an amazing job capturing the tone of this war and really brings the human element to an inhumane setting.</p>

<br />The Paul Reiser Show has a similar flavor, only Reiser plays a fictionalized version himself, using it to his advantage and showing people the RIDICULOUS things we as actors will put up with in Hollywood.&nbsp; It's nice to see him just being him and jokingly admitting to guest star Larry David that he is a ""little bit of a douchebag"" because let's face it -&nbsp; if you live in L.A., you're a little bit of a douchebag, too. <br /><br />The Paul Reiser Show is unapologetically a mix of The Comeback + Entourage + Curb Your Enthusiasm and has no problems owning up to it. Larry David sums it up best when he tells Reiser over lunch that he SHOULD do a reality show&hellip;""Like 'Curb Your Enthusiasm', only with you"". <br /><br />So was it a rousing success? Probably not. Did I enjoy it? Absolutely. I think it's okay if it had a wobbly first night, considering it's awkward premiere date and the now what is quickly becoming known as the ""Kiss of Death""&nbsp; 8:30 time slot. I know a LOT of my colleagues are drinking the Haterade but I really think this show deserves another episode to find its groove and if it STILL doesn't work, thanks for playing. <br /><br />Then there's Will Ferrell's first day at The Office.&nbsp; Where to start&hellip;wow, um&hellip;<br /><br />So as EVERYONE knows, Steve Carell is leaving the show and Ferrell has stepped in as successor to the Dunder-Mifflin management throne, Deangelo Vickers.&nbsp; <br /><br />In last week's episode, Michael and Holly get engaged (yay!) and announce they're&nbsp; moving to Colorado to take care of Holly's rather senile parents (boo!). So when Vickers first arrives in this episode, the entire office sees this as a ""do-over"" of sorts to curry favor with the new boss (except for Dwight, of course).&nbsp; He seems like a nice enough fellow - likable, handsome, nice sense of humor&hellip;<br /><br />Then it gets a little weird. <br /><br />It's soon evident that Vickers is ready to start changing things in the office that Michael himself implemented during his tenure, much to Michael's dismay (but says nothing).&nbsp; The more it seems the gang (minus Dwight, of course) loves the new boss, the more Michael starts to feel unappreciated and swiftly begins to resent Vickers' arrival&hellip;with strange yet funny results.<br /><br />What works: the chemistry between Michael and Vickers is GREAT. Carell and Farrell are AWESOME as two grown men in a position of power who act like they're in the 5th grade. I've always been a fan of both these men and to see them together in a place like this is like a dream come true. The subtlety of their comedic timing is unparalleled. <br /><br />In the first few minutes of Michael and Vickers running around together joking and laughing, I was immediately reminded of the Step Brothers music montage when Brennan and Dale become friends and run around and do silly stuff.&nbsp; I actually said ""So, are they gonna be going to the f***in Catalina Wine Mixer, too, or what?""<br /><br />

<p>Last night was THE night that people have been talking about for months: the world premiere of HBO's new series, Game of Thrones.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_SniTwfm5BwE/TJvj5msdXyI/AAAAAAAAC1A/UsEDRS2a2wI/s1600/Game+of+Thrones+Possible+Logo.png"" alt="""" width=""560"" height=""320"" /></p>
<p>Based on the first book of George R.R. Martin's 7 book fantasy series, ""A Song of Fire and Ice"", Game of Thrones hit the ground running with an a VERY in your debut&hellip;which I find extremely fitting for this kind of genre. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And now, The Frame Rate</p>
<p>For those like me who haven't read the novels nor have played the card, board, or Role Playing Games before; the idea of having to meet and remember four of the seven families in the Seven Kingdoms in 45 minutes can seem a bit overwhelming, without question. Luckily, HBO thought of that and were smart enough to present a 25 minute ""Making of"" special that aired before the show's premiere. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There are times when casting can make or break a show before the pilot even airs&hellip;we've all seen it happen before. While this COULD'VE been the case with GoT, it's clear HBO knew what they were doing casting Sean Bean, best known for his role as Boromir from The Lord of The Rings: The Fellowship of The Ring. &nbsp;</p>
<p><img src=""http://www.jasonocampo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/061310-eddard-sword-1920.jpeg"" alt="""" width=""560"" height=""320"" /></p>
<p>In LOTR, Boromir was not only a soldier who was greatly admired for his great strength and prowess on the battlefield; he was also an honorable and noble man who loved his kingdom who would die (and did) to defend it. In GoT, Bean steps into a similar role as Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of The North; known for his strong sense of honor and loyalty.&nbsp; In this aspect, fans automatically accept Bean in this role and are more willing to invest in not only Stark but the relationships of those in the Seven Kingdoms as well. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A lot of comparisons have been made to LOTR and it's hard NOT to, considering the setting, story, and characters (Martin has been called 'The American Tolkien' on more than one occasion) but that's really where the similarities end. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In LOTR, you won't find twins engaged in an incestual relationship (that one, I actually called); a brother (who is an evil DOUCHEBAG, btw) evaluating his 15 year old sister's naked body for flaws (EW) before marrying her off against her will; or seeing a man disemboweled in a fight after being interrupted mid-coitus with a concubine (in full view of everyone) at a wedding celebration where if at least three people DON'T die, is considered a dull affair&hellip;but you WILL find these things in GoT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trust me, I DO hate stuff&hellip;but there's NOTHING about this show I didn't like. I audibly gasped a few times and yelled things like ""I KNEW IT"", ""EW"" and ""OH MY GOD"" on several occasions.&nbsp; This show is extremely visceral, violent, and doesn't ""PG"" anything, as evidenced in the first FIVE minutes of the show&hellip;I yelled ""OMG"" ""What the f*** is that?! RUN!!!!""</p>
<p>""IS this show good for kids under 13?""&nbsp;</p>
<p>Considering the opening sequence shows a tableau of murdered and dismembered villagers (including children), a seemingly dead child spiked to a tree and with what transpires immediately after; probably not. NO one is safe in this series and it could be a hard thing to explain to your kids why it's NOT okay for a brother and sister to have sex or why someone would throw a kid out a window.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's definitely a 'must be this tall to ride' feel to this show. Use your best judgment but if you're considering whether or not your young'un can see this show, I'd HIGHLY recommend watching it first on your own.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The storyline is so intricate that it would be IMPOSSIBLE to be as thorough as I'd like without writing a novel of my own and you really should watch yourself, at any rate. We're talking loyalty, politics, espionage, murder, sex, deception, and VERY strange sibling relationships.&nbsp; I wouldn't call it ""excessively violent"", though&hellip;I'd actually classify this as ""appropriately violent"" as nothing is gratuitous and serves purpose within the storyline.</p>
<p>Another thing they did that I really dig is that in the opening credits, the corresponding character's crest is shown next to the actor's name&hellip;which also helped me figure out who's who.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, the first episode may SEEM a bit overwhelming but trust me it'll be worth it. How worth it? I've watched the first episode 4 times yesterday and has been playing in the background as I'm writing this. Game of Thrones is a truly cinematic masterpiece made for the small screen. Even the cast is ridiculously good looking for different reasons and have a feeling that Daenerys (played by Emilia Clarke) who'll give Sookie Stackhouse some SERIOUS competition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Side note:&nbsp; Keep an eye on Peter Dinklage, who is BRILLIANT as Tyrion Lannister -&nbsp; he steals every scene he's in without even trying and looks DAMN sexy as a blonde.</p>

<p>And because I love this show so much, I'm gonna give you a little pressie. Here's the official making of GoT that aired before last night's premiere, provided by their official YouTube channel!</p>
<p>IF you haven't read the books and are afraid you won't be able to catch on quickly, watch this video first and you'll be ready to hit the Seven Kingdoms in no time.</p>

"153","0","The Frame Rate: LA NOIRE","The Frame Rate: LA NOIRE","","",,"<p>The Frame Rate: LA NOIRE<br /> by <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/crixlee"" target=""_blank"">Crix Lee</a><br /><br />Yeah yeah, it's not a film or a tv show&hellip;but after you read this, you'll know WHY I'm talking about it today. <br /><br />Working in the gaming industry, I sometimes get caught up in certain game titles from the FIRST day I see a trailer or an early build of said game. Last week, I was summoned to the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel and treated to a private demo of Rockstar Games' HIGHLY anticipated title, L.A. Noire. <br /><br />OH MY GAH, you guys. Where to begin?<br /><br />In L.A. Noire, you are L.A.P.D Detective Cole Phelps (Aaron Staton, Mad Men) in a post-war setting where corruption, drugs, and murder are exploding at an alarming rate.&nbsp; Phelps must dig deep to solve a number of cases that include a serial arsonist, racketeering conspiracies, savage murders, the L.A. underworld and exposing police corruption that could bring the city to its knees.&nbsp; As Phelps, you'll explore every bit of Los Angeles ca. 1947 in ""an open-ended challenge to solve a series of murder mysteries"" from different departments of the L.A.P.D.</p>
<p><a title=""LA Noire_screenshot_206 by popgalaxy, on Flickr"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/61215387@N04/5642381808/""><img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5101/5642381808_549ff939e1.jpg"" alt=""LA Noire_screenshot_206"" width=""500"" height=""281"" /></a><br /><br />If you're sitting there thinking ""Well, this sounds like L.A. Confidential meets Chinatown"", you'd be absolutely right&hellip;but with a twist.&nbsp; Inspired by infamous cases like The Black Dahlia murders, L.A. Noire does NOT hold back on ANYTHING and nothing is censored.<br /><br />Phelps has cases in Traffic, Arson, Homicide, and Vice; with a different partner assigned to him in each case.&nbsp; <br /><br />In the case that I was shown, ""The Red Lipstick Murder"" (Homicide desk) is based on the 1947 unsolved murder of Jeanne French and the in game crime scene shows a woman who'd been brutally murdered and things written on her nude body in red lipstick; including the initials ""B.D."" (Black Dahlia murder had happened weeks before French's death, initially leading police to work both the serial killer and copycat angles)<br /><br /><a title=""LA Noire_screenshot_240 by popgalaxy, on Flickr"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/61215387@N04/5641812117/""><img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5101/5641812117_d5c000a746.jpg"" alt=""LA Noire_screenshot_240"" width=""500"" height=""281"" /></a><br /><br />And when I say ""nude"", I mean NUDE.&nbsp; But the thing about it is that for a split second, you're like ""Oh wow, she's TOTALLY FULL FRONTAL naked"" then brush it off as you study her body for clues and research the crime scene and because Forensics were on the scene before you, everything is marked so you can go from clue to clue somewhat effortlessly.&nbsp; <br /><br />Each site includes a very subtle music cue similar to what you would find in films in the forms of ""investigation music"" and a two fingered piano trill that indicates that there's a clue nearby and when all clues are collected; the investigation music stops.&nbsp; But remember this: NOT everything you find is relevant to the case. IF you want a bit of a challenge, you can turn the music off. Once the crime scene is clear, it's time to start pounding the pavement and interrogating suspects.<br /><br />Here's where it gets really interesting. Because L.A. Noire uses motion scan technology to capture the actor's subtle nuances and facial expressions in a way that has never been done before. Because the actors performances are recorded in a stark white room surrounded by 32 cameras (where they cannot move around), facial expressions and body gestures are captured from every angle; meaning even the smallest microexpression (while somewhat obvious) are amazingly realistic and help you decide how to move forward in your investigation. The motion scan technology is so detailed, you can make even make out the wrinkles and veins on hands! <br /><br /><a title=""LA Noire_screenshot_219 by popgalaxy, on Flickr"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/61215387@N04/5641811887/""><img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5183/5641811887_7bf9d01902.jpg"" alt=""LA Noire_screenshot_219"" width=""500"" height=""281"" /></a><br /><br />This technology comes into play when interrogating suspects.&nbsp; As you ask question your suspect/witness, you can decide ""truth, doubt, or lie"" based on their answer and microexpressions (darting eyes, shifting in seat) and the direction of your case is based on your decisions. <br /><br />There's ONE important thing you should know:&nbsp; THERE ARE NO ""THROWAWAY"" MOVES, NO THROWAWAY ACTIONS. You only get ONE shot to question a suspect and once you're done, YOU'RE DONE. You CANNOT quit and go back to an old save, NOR can you can go back and question that person again in that particular area, so pay attention and choose wisely.&nbsp; ""Intuition points"" can be used to remove incorrect questions, evidence, look for clues&hellip;and will also tie into the Rockstar Social Club. <br /><br />Your objectives, questions, and recording of clues come in the form of a notebook that you can consult at any time. At the end of the interrogation, you'll find out how many of the questions you got right and you'll move forward from there. But don't panic&hellip;although this is like ""Choose Your Own Adventure"", you will ALWAYS get to the end result. Whether you take the long or short way, the case will be solved. <br /><br />All in-game phones are functional and can be used to call dispatch and some of the props can be interacted with as well, rumor has it you might be able to even jump and ride trolleys! Mini games come in the form of ""unassigned cases"" (robberies, muggings, etc) that are not only interesting but can get you experience points. This includes successful interrogations, discovering landmarks, etc. <br /><br />Each case takes around 45-90 minutes to complete and a case never has the same experience, which means it has an AWESOME replay value.&nbsp; Our rep told us that he played the particular case he showed us REPEATEDLY and when a colleague played the same case, found scandals our guy didn't even know EXISTED. THAT is fantastiballs (my word, you like?)<br /><br />Fans of Mad Men, 24, and Southland will recognize many of the characters - another HUGE testament to the motion scan technology. I am a hardcore Southland fan and when I saw Michael McGrady and how he moves in the game, I thought, ""Jebus, it looks EXACTLY LIKE HIM"" <br /><br />The cut scenes are some of the best I've come across.&nbsp; In most games, the cut scenes interrupt the flow of gameplay like ""BLAM BLAM BLAM! cut scene, wait for game to load&hellip;BLAM BLAM BLAM!"". Yuck, right? In L.A. Noire, not the case. Each vignette/cut scene is inserted seamlessly into the gameplay so the game has the richness of a feature film. <br /><br />Here's the latest video about L.A. Noire that Rockstar Games released earlier today:<br /><br /><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/l1eUEMnYBtk?hd=1"" width=""560"" height=""349"" frameborder=""0""></iframe><br /><br />So, how amazing IS this game? My colleague and I said ""Wow"" about 15 times during the 30 minute demo while shaking our heads in disbelief at how beautiful and smooth the game looked. <br /><br />When you play L.A. Noire, you'll see WHY it not only took FOUR YEARS to make but why it was made an Official Selection at the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival, making it the FIRST EVER video game Official Selection at a film festival. THAT'S HUGE, people. <br /><br />(You'll also be happy to know that it will be available in surround sound, but don't even ask if it'll be in 3D, because it won't and I for one am STOKED about that.)<br /><br />L.A. Noire will be available for Xbox 360 and PS3 on May 17th, 2011 with bonus items for those who pre-order. <br /><br />The Frame Rate: Looks like we're on the case, kid. Crix Approved<br /><br /></p>","<p>The Frame Rate: LA NOIRE<br /> by <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/crixlee"" target=""_blank"">Crix Lee</a><br /><br />Yeah yeah, it's not a film or a tv show&hellip;but after you read this, you'll know WHY I'm talking about it today. <br /><br />Working in the gaming industry, I sometimes get caught up in certain game titles from the FIRST day I see a trailer or an early build of said game. Last week, I was summoned to the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel and treated to a private demo of Rockstar Games' HIGHLY anticipated title, L.A. Noire. <br /><br />OH MY GAH, you guys. Where to begin?<br /><br />In L.A. Noire, you are L.A.P.D Detective Cole Phelps (Aaron Staton, Mad Men) in a post-war setting where corruption, drugs, and murder are exploding at an alarming rate.&nbsp; Phelps must dig deep to solve a number of cases that include a serial arsonist, racketeering conspiracies, savage murders, the L.A. underworld and exposing police corruption that could bring the city to its knees.&nbsp; As Phelps, you'll explore every bit of Los Angeles ca. 1947 in ""an open-ended challenge to solve a series of murder mysteries"" from different departments of the L.A.P.D.</p>
<p><a title=""LA Noire_screenshot_206 by popgalaxy, on Flickr"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/61215387@N04/5642381808/""><img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5101/5642381808_549ff939e1.jpg"" alt=""LA Noire_screenshot_206"" width=""500"" height=""281"" /></a><br /><br />If you're sitting there thinking ""Well, this sounds like L.A. Confidential meets Chinatown"", you'd be absolutely right&hellip;but with a twist.&nbsp; Inspired by infamous cases like The Black Dahlia murders, L.A. Noire does NOT hold back on ANYTHING and nothing is censored.<br /><br />Phelps has cases in Traffic, Arson, Homicide, and Vice; with a different partner assigned to him in each case.&nbsp; <br /><br />In the case that I was shown, ""The Red Lipstick Murder"" (Homicide desk) is based on the 1947 unsolved murder of Jeanne French and the in game crime scene shows a woman who'd been brutally murdered and things written on her nude body in red lipstick; including the initials ""B.D."" (Black Dahlia murder had happened weeks before French's death, initially leading police to work both the serial killer and copycat angles)<br /><br /><a title=""LA Noire_screenshot_240 by popgalaxy, on Flickr"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/61215387@N04/5641812117/""><img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5101/5641812117_d5c000a746.jpg"" alt=""LA Noire_screenshot_240"" width=""500"" height=""281"" /></a><br /><br />And when I say ""nude"", I mean NUDE.&nbsp; But the thing about it is that for a split second, you're like ""Oh wow, she's TOTALLY FULL FRONTAL naked"" then brush it off as you study her body for clues and research the crime scene and because Forensics were on the scene before you, everything is marked so you can go from clue to clue somewhat effortlessly.&nbsp; <br /><br />Each site includes a very subtle music cue similar to what you would find in films in the forms of ""investigation music"" and a two fingered piano trill that indicates that there's a clue nearby and when all clues are collected; the investigation music stops.&nbsp; But remember this: NOT everything you find is relevant to the case. IF you want a bit of a challenge, you can turn the music off. Once the crime scene is clear, it's time to start pounding the pavement and interrogating suspects.<br /><br />Here's where it gets really interesting. Because L.A. Noire uses motion scan technology to capture the actor's subtle nuances and facial expressions in a way that has never been done before. Because the actors performances are recorded in a stark white room surrounded by 32 cameras (where they cannot move around), facial expressions and body gestures are captured from every angle; meaning even the smallest microexpression (while somewhat obvious) are amazingly realistic and help you decide how to move forward in your investigation. The motion scan technology is so detailed, you can make even make out the wrinkles and veins on hands! <br /><br /><a title=""LA Noire_screenshot_219 by popgalaxy, on Flickr"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/61215387@N04/5641811887/""><img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5183/5641811887_7bf9d01902.jpg"" alt=""LA Noire_screenshot_219"" width=""500"" height=""281"" /></a><br /><br />This technology comes into play when interrogating suspects.&nbsp; As you ask question your suspect/witness, you can decide ""truth, doubt, or lie"" based on their answer and microexpressions (darting eyes, shifting in seat) and the direction of your case is based on your decisions. <br /><br />There's ONE important thing you should know:&nbsp; THERE ARE NO ""THROWAWAY"" MOVES, NO THROWAWAY ACTIONS. You only get ONE shot to question a suspect and once you're done, YOU'RE DONE. You CANNOT quit and go back to an old save, NOR can you can go back and question that person again in that particular area, so pay attention and choose wisely.&nbsp; ""Intuition points"" can be used to remove incorrect questions, evidence, look for clues&hellip;and will also tie into the Rockstar Social Club. <br /><br />Your objectives, questions, and recording of clues come in the form of a notebook that you can consult at any time. At the end of the interrogation, you'll find out how many of the questions you got right and you'll move forward from there. But don't panic&hellip;although this is like ""Choose Your Own Adventure"", you will ALWAYS get to the end result. Whether you take the long or short way, the case will be solved. <br /><br />All in-game phones are functional and can be used to call dispatch and some of the props can be interacted with as well, rumor has it you might be able to even jump and ride trolleys! Mini games come in the form of ""unassigned cases"" (robberies, muggings, etc) that are not only interesting but can get you experience points. This includes successful interrogations, discovering landmarks, etc. <br /><br />Each case takes around 45-90 minutes to complete and a case never has the same experience, which means it has an AWESOME replay value.&nbsp; Our rep told us that he played the particular case he showed us REPEATEDLY and when a colleague played the same case, found scandals our guy didn't even know EXISTED. THAT is fantastiballs (my word, you like?)<br /><br />Fans of Mad Men, 24, and Southland will recognize many of the characters - another HUGE testament to the motion scan technology. I am a hardcore Southland fan and when I saw Michael McGrady and how he moves in the game, I thought, ""Jebus, it looks EXACTLY LIKE HIM"" <br /><br />The cut scenes are some of the best I've come across.&nbsp; In most games, the cut scenes interrupt the flow of gameplay like ""BLAM BLAM BLAM! cut scene, wait for game to load&hellip;BLAM BLAM BLAM!"". Yuck, right? In L.A. Noire, not the case. Each vignette/cut scene is inserted seamlessly into the gameplay so the game has the richness of a feature film. <br /><br />Here's the latest video about L.A. Noire that Rockstar Games released earlier today:<br /><br /><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/l1eUEMnYBtk?hd=1"" width=""560"" height=""349"" frameborder=""0""></iframe><br /><br />So, how amazing IS this game? My colleague and I said ""Wow"" about 15 times during the 30 minute demo while shaking our heads in disbelief at how beautiful and smooth the game looked. <br /><br />When you play L.A. Noire, you'll see WHY it not only took FOUR YEARS to make but why it was made an Official Selection at the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival, making it the FIRST EVER video game Official Selection at a film festival. THAT'S HUGE, people. <br /><br />(You'll also be happy to know that it will be available in surround sound, but don't even ask if it'll be in 3D, because it won't and I for one am STOKED about that.)<br /><br />L.A. Noire will be available for Xbox 360 and PS3 on May 17th, 2011 with bonus items for those who pre-order. <br /><br />The Frame Rate: Looks like we're on the case, kid.

<p>David Simon's unflinching look at life in a post-Katrina New Orleans returns to HBO and continues to cast a light on the recovery of a city, its people and its culture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After an auspicious debut season which focused on the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, ""Treme's"" second season premiere picks up the story six months later as residents of the Crescent City continue to rebuild and renew their broken home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the most part, this season's opening episode is limited to catching viewers up with the lives of their favorite characters, which is perfectly fine. Fans of the first season will be able to appreciate the changes that have taken place, while new viewers are treated to a solid primer of those characters. The result is the establishing of a foundation upon which Simon and company will hopefully construct another 10 episodes of great storytelling.</p>

<p>Of course, the two cultural touchstones that New Orleans is best known for, food and music, are once again treated as background characters in the show. This season, David Simon has enlisted chef and author Anthony Bourdain to contribute his unique perspective to the storyline for chef (and New Orleans ex-pat) Janette Desatuel (Kim Dickens).</p>

<p>If last night's episode is any indication, the city's deep roster of musical talent will be very well represented this season.&nbsp;The second season premiere featured guest appearances and performances from the likes of the legendary Subdudes, rock / trombone hybrid Bonerama, troubadour John Boutte and a wild musical performance from Galactic, featuring The Dirty Dozen Brass Band and rapper Juvenile that has to be seen to be believed. &nbsp;</p>

<p>There's a common memory that we twenty- and thirty-somethings all have, I think: it's summertime in the 1990s. Clad in fashionably-questionable jeans and Ninja Turtles t-shirts, we clustered around a Mortal Kombat arcade machine to watch or be watched. To kill or be killed.

We just wanted to rip out a spine or two.<br /><br />I haven't played a Mortal Kombat game since those days of Mortal Kombat I and II. Other titles in the series have come and gone, but none really seemed to live up to the glory days of the franchise. I didn't think I was missing anything.

It feels fluid, deadly fast. There's little to none of the clunkiness (klunkiness?) you might expect while playing a fighting game -- you're dizzingly lethal. Every attack connects with a gratifying ""thunk"" or ""scrnch"" of brutalized flesh and bone. The gameplay is pretty simple, with a series of complex combos you can build into which are actually unique for every character. The new tag team functionality works seamlessly and allows you to swap characters out mid-combat or call them in for support (as in Marvel vs. Capcom), but you also have the ability to swap mid-combo for even more complex sets of attacks.</p>

As you fight and use special attacks, you level up this meter into three separate power sections. In the first tier, your special attacks get extra oomph. In the second tier, you're able to execute a combo breaker to interrupt your opponent. And in the third tier, you gain the ability to do what is probably the coolest part of this new Mortal Kombat installment: a super sweet, super powerful X-ray attack. This is pretty much exactly what you might expect. You hit your opponent crazy hard, and the game dramatically shifts in to demonstrate in slow motion an X-ray-vision shot of exactly how you're decimating their poor skeleton and other assorted internal organs.<br /><br />And let's not forget the Fatalities....

(I, however, haven't had a chance to test out much of the online multiplayer, as in my ever-abundant foolishness I was playing the game on PS3 in the Great PSN Blackout of 2011.)<br /><br />In any case, if you're a fan of Mortal Kombat, you're going to want to check this one out. If you're not, you might want to check it out anyway.

<p><span id=""internal-source-marker_0.6840739228484288"">With  Dylan Dog: Dead of Night hitting the theatres this week featuring a  tattooed Super Zombie; does the world really need another Zombie story?<br /><br /><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/H3r4BbwcUJw"" width=""560"" height=""349"" frameborder=""0""></iframe><br /><br />The  answer to this question for any zombie fan is an obvious YES! But for  those who are not into the whole zombie-thing are probably scratching  their heads asking why? </span><br /><br />The answer is easy and hopefully this will help non-zombie goers understand our fascination with Zombies. <br /><br />One  of the worst possible disasters would have to be a Zombie Apocalypse.  Even beyond an alien invasion as seen in Skyline or Battle LA. A zombie  apocalypse is the only disaster that turns those you love and count on,  against you. It&rsquo;s the only disaster that opens the possibility of you  being eaten alive by the people you care about. What is more horrible  and heart wrenching than that? <br /><br />Though  being eaten alive is just the start, that doesn&rsquo;t include all the other  bad stuff that comes with an Apocalypse. Shortage of supplies, no safe  place to run, crazy nomads and no hope. It brings out the absolute worst  in mankind, every man for himself. Not to mention, unless it is caused  by something divine, it&rsquo;s one of the only disasters that we as humans  cause. Military testing out a new weapon or nuclear meltdown mutates  people into flesh eating monsters. Either way, it is a reflection on  society, and where some people speculate we are headed as a self  destructive civilization. <br /><br />When  you watch a zombie movie or read a story, if you can get beyond the  whole &lsquo;could this really happen,&rsquo; what you&rsquo;re left with is a sense of  fear that doesn&rsquo;t exist in any other genre. Tell me, how would you react  if your spouse or kid started running after you trying to eat your  brains? You have two choices, kill the one you love or join them in the  undead. Either way you lose. Or maybe you fend yourself off and kill  your way out, but in the process you got a small bite. Well, you lose  again. <br /><br />So  it&rsquo;s not the gore or superficial horror of zombie stories that drive  people&rsquo;s obsession with the genre. Even the worst cheesy zombie movies  stir a question deep inside and pose the question, &ldquo;How long would I  survive in a Zombie Apocalypse.&rdquo;<br /><br />Now ask yourself, how well are you prepared?<br /><br />If  you&rsquo;re not, well that&rsquo;s ok, below I&rsquo;ve included a list of a few  upcoming Zombie movies that you should check out to get you prepared.  &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve also listed my top 5 of all time and a couple that zombie fans  should check out. <br /><br />2011  looks to be the year of Zombies! Let&rsquo;s just hope we don&rsquo;t see emo  zombies in a Twilight: Team Undead movie where they will sparkle before  they eat you. Zombie fan or not, prepare yourself for the undead as they  horde the movie theatres and shelves. Here are a few that I&rsquo;m looking  forward too.<br /><br /><br />Upcoming Zombie Flicks<br />Pride and Prejudice and Zombies - Natalie Portman will produce and star in this mixture of Jane Austen and Zombies. Should be interesting. <br /><br />Zombieland 2 - If you haven&rsquo;t seen the first one, do yourself a favor and watch it.  When it comes to rules of surviving the Apocalypse, this one has some  great points. Not to mention it&rsquo;s funny and we get Bill Murray as a  zombie. <br /><br />28 Months Later - Quite possibly my favorite zombie series and will tackle the issue of  the virus getting out of the UK. Let&rsquo;s just hope if an Apocalypse did  happen, we want the moaning, shuffling zombies, not the ones shown in  this series. Scary!<br /><br />The Riot -  Ron Perlman is starring in this one which starts with a group of people  trying to survive a riot and come to find out they have to worry about  the undead too! Sounds like this could be a good one. <br /><br />Dead Season - This indy zombie movie focuses on the idea of survival, and how the  zombies will bring out the best and the worst in all of us. <br /><a href=""http://www.deadseasonmovie.com/"">http://www.deadseasonmovie.com/</a> has more info.

<p><span id=""internal-source-marker_0.6840739228484288"">With  Dylan Dog: Dead of Night hitting the theatres this week featuring a  tattooed Super Zombie; does the world really need another Zombie story?<br /><br /><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/H3r4BbwcUJw"" width=""560"" height=""349"" frameborder=""0""></iframe><br /><br />The  answer to this question for any zombie fan is an obvious YES! But for  those who are not into the whole zombie-thing are probably scratching  their heads asking why? </span><br /><br />The answer is easy and hopefully this will help non-zombie goers understand our fascination with Zombies. <br /><br />One  of the worst possible disasters would have to be a Zombie Apocalypse.  Even beyond an alien invasion as seen in Skyline or Battle LA. A zombie  apocalypse is the only disaster that turns those you love and count on,  against you. It&rsquo;s the only disaster that opens the possibility of you  being eaten alive by the people you care about. What is more horrible  and heart wrenching than that? <br /><br />Though  being eaten alive is just the start, that doesn&rsquo;t include all the other  bad stuff that comes with an Apocalypse. Shortage of supplies, no safe  place to run, crazy nomads and no hope. It brings out the absolute worst  in mankind, every man for himself. Not to mention, unless it is caused  by something divine, it&rsquo;s one of the only disasters that we as humans  cause. Military testing out a new weapon or nuclear meltdown mutates  people into flesh eating monsters. Either way, it is a reflection on  society, and where some people speculate we are headed as a self  destructive civilization. <br /><br />When  you watch a zombie movie or read a story, if you can get beyond the  whole &lsquo;could this really happen,&rsquo; what you&rsquo;re left with is a sense of  fear that doesn&rsquo;t exist in any other genre. Tell me, how would you react  if your spouse or kid started running after you trying to eat your  brains? You have two choices, kill the one you love or join them in the  undead. Either way you lose. Or maybe you fend yourself off and kill  your way out, but in the process you got a small bite. Well, you lose  again. <br /><br />So  it&rsquo;s not the gore or superficial horror of zombie stories that drive  people&rsquo;s obsession with the genre. Even the worst cheesy zombie movies  stir a question deep inside and pose the question, &ldquo;How long would I  survive in a Zombie Apocalypse.&rdquo;<br /><br />Now ask yourself, how well are you prepared?<br /><br />If  you&rsquo;re not, well that&rsquo;s ok, below I&rsquo;ve included a list of a few  upcoming Zombie movies that you should check out to get you prepared.  &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve also listed my top 5 of all time and a couple that zombie fans  should check out. <br /><br />2011  looks to be the year of Zombies! Let&rsquo;s just hope we don&rsquo;t see emo  zombies in a Twilight: Team Undead movie where they will sparkle before  they eat you. Zombie fan or not, prepare yourself for the undead as they  horde the movie theatres and shelves. Here are a few that I&rsquo;m looking  forward too.<br /><br /><br />Upcoming Zombie Flicks<br />Pride and Prejudice and Zombies - Natalie Portman will produce and star in this mixture of Jane Austen and Zombies. Should be interesting. <br /><br />Zombieland 2 - If you haven&rsquo;t seen the first one, do yourself a favor and watch it.  When it comes to rules of surviving the Apocalypse, this one has some  great points. Not to mention it&rsquo;s funny and we get Bill Murray as a  zombie. <br /><br />28 Months Later - Quite possibly my favorite zombie series and will tackle the issue of  the virus getting out of the UK. Let&rsquo;s just hope if an Apocalypse did  happen, we want the moaning, shuffling zombies, not the ones shown in  this series. Scary!<br /><br />The Riot -  Ron Perlman is starring in this one which starts with a group of people  trying to survive a riot and come to find out they have to worry about  the undead too! Sounds like this could be a good one. <br /><br />Dead Season - This indy zombie movie focuses on the idea of survival, and how the  zombies will bring out the best and the worst in all of us. <br /><a href=""http://www.deadseasonmovie.com/"">http://www.deadseasonmovie.com/</a> has more info.

<p>&ldquo;Wolverine knows that she played a part in the plot that had him sent  to hell, and she&rsquo;s the only lead he has,&rdquo; explains series writer Jason  Aaron. &ldquo;WOLVERINE #9 is a standalone story that has Logan going after  Mystique, and acts as a continuation of the earlier story arc &lsquo;Get  Mystique&rsquo; and the brief reprise in DARK X-MEN: BEGINNINGS #3.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Wolverine&rsquo;s not the only one  hunting down Mystique; she also has a murderous new villain named Lord  Deathstrike to contend with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord Deathstrike appears pretty  mysterious in this issue, but in [the] next issue we&rsquo;ll definitely see  what he can do and just what he&rsquo;s capable of,&rdquo; says Aaron. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the  world&rsquo;s greatest assassin, and once he puts his sights on Mystique she&rsquo;s  in trouble.

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been in a love/hate  relationship going back years,&rdquo; notes the writer. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been allies  and lovers, but most of the time they&rsquo;ve been at each other&rsquo;s throats.  Mystique carries a deep-seated hatred of Wolverine, and that&rsquo;s why she  got involved in the plot to send him to hell in the first place. Once  she kind of figured out what the whole plan was, she wasn&rsquo;t comfortable  with it. We find out why in this upcoming issue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you saw in the finale of &lsquo;Get  Mystique,&rsquo; when Logan finally had the chance to kill her he didn&rsquo;t do  it. Obviously there&rsquo;s still some feelings and respect there between  them, but by the end of this story those may go out the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wolverine and Mystique&rsquo;s  relationship comes to a head because of the machinations of the Red  Right Hand.

<p>Adult Swim's Flagship Show Gets Reboot<br /><br />But was it really necessary?&nbsp; <br /><br />On September 2, 2001, Cartoon Network launched their late night, adult-oriented cartoon block and named it [adult swim].&nbsp; Airing from 9pm to 6am,&nbsp; AS fills our eyeholes with original programming (Metalocalypse,&nbsp; Robot Chicken, Venture Brothers, The Boondocks), syndicated shows (Family Guy, American Dad, King of the Hill) and Saturday night anime blocks (Bleach and Fullmetal Alchemist).&nbsp; <br /><br />But now something is on the horizon and I'm not sure if I really want to see it happen&hellip;AS' flagship show, Aqua Teen Hunger Force (ATHF), is getting a reboot.&nbsp; <br /><br /><a title=""ATHF by popgalaxy, on Flickr"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/61215387@N04/5665680073/""><img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5224/5665680073_058399f03d.jpg"" alt=""ATHF"" width=""500"" height=""261"" /></a><br /><br />The longest running original series on Adult Swim, ATHF originally premiered before Adult Swim existed. Back in December of 2000, AS was a small block of shows dubbed the ""Williams Street"" block (with Sealab 2021, The Brak Show, Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law) before officially becoming the nine hour block we know today. <br /><br />In ATHF, we follow the exploits of three living, breathing, TALKING fast food characters: Master Shake, Frylock, and Meatwad, who live in the suburbs of New Jersey. Originally, the show started out with these three fighting crime and solving mysteries but after three episodes, that idea was chucked and with the addition of their neighbor, Carl (who has a love/hate for them) the show turned into more of a very, very, surreal version of Seinfeld.&nbsp; Sight gags galore, goofy plotlines, aliens and the joys of getting a job have all been explored for the last 10 years and 100 episodes.&nbsp; Along with an all-star roster of guest stars (including Zakk Wilde, Glenn Danzig, David Cross, Bill Hader, Scott Adsit, and Fred Armisen); this show went from a show I didn't understand in the beginning (and HATED) to a show that I LOVE and will punch anyone in the face that says differently. <br /><br />(Not really, but I WILL try to ""box set bully"" you into liking it! haha)<br /><br />I come from the ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" school of thought and get VERY nervous when beloved shows decide to futz around with their storyline and characters; because it usually leads to it being its LAST SEASON. Like when Fonzie jumped the shark (Happy Days) or Cousin Oliver coming to live with The Brady Bunch.&nbsp; <br /><br />And boy, did they retool&hellip;and I am afraid because from what I'm seeing and hearing so far, I do not heart. <br /><br />Now renamed ""Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1"", we find the team going back to their roots and solving crimes - in Seattle.&nbsp; Yeah, that's what I said&hellip;followed by ""What about Carl? Better find a way to bring him, too, or this new show is toast.""<br /><br />I AM relieved to know that George Lowe (best known to AS fans from ""Space Ghost Coast to Coast"") will appear in every episode of the new season and reoccurring show openers Dr Weird&nbsp; (""Gentlemen, BEHOLD!"") and Steve will be returning as well. But there's a nagging question that goes with that: as Dr Weird's lab is located on the ""South Jersey Shore"", does this mean they'll be getting new digs on one of the islands near Seattle? <br /><br />In my experience, sometimes changing the theme to a show can help or hurt it.&nbsp; This season of U.S. of Tara (Showtime) has decided to get rid of their show's opening sequence and theme song altogether and in some ways, it kind of lost some of the magic that went with it, BUT when The Drew Carey Show changed theirs from an animated version of Drew singing the whimsical ""Moon Over Parma"" (which was MY fave) to Drew and fellow castrates lip-synching ""Cleveland Rocks"" (where the show was set) with a montage of the city and people of Cleveland; the ratings skyrocketed. <br /><br />When I think ATHF, I think of Schoolly D's BRILLIANT opening theme:<br /><br /> 
<object width=""480"" height=""390"">

<p>Adult Swim's Flagship Show Gets Reboot<br /><br />But was it really necessary?&nbsp; <br /><br />On September 2, 2001, Cartoon Network launched their late night, adult-oriented cartoon block and named it [adult swim].&nbsp; Airing from 9pm to 6am,&nbsp; AS fills our eyeholes with original programming (Metalocalypse,&nbsp; Robot Chicken, Venture Brothers, The Boondocks), syndicated shows (Family Guy, American Dad, King of the Hill) and Saturday night anime blocks (Bleach and Fullmetal Alchemist).&nbsp; <br /><br />But now something is on the horizon and I'm not sure if I really want to see it happen&hellip;AS' flagship show, Aqua Teen Hunger Force (ATHF), is getting a reboot.&nbsp; <br /><br /><a title=""ATHF by popgalaxy, on Flickr"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/61215387@N04/5665680073/""><img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5224/5665680073_058399f03d.jpg"" alt=""ATHF"" width=""500"" height=""261"" /></a><br /><br />The longest running original series on Adult Swim, ATHF originally premiered before Adult Swim existed. Back in December of 2000, AS was a small block of shows dubbed the ""Williams Street"" block (with Sealab 2021, The Brak Show, Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law) before officially becoming the nine hour block we know today. <br /><br />In ATHF, we follow the exploits of three living, breathing, TALKING fast food characters: Master Shake, Frylock, and Meatwad, who live in the suburbs of New Jersey. Originally, the show started out with these three fighting crime and solving mysteries but after three episodes, that idea was chucked and with the addition of their neighbor, Carl (who has a love/hate for them) the show turned into more of a very, very, surreal version of Seinfeld.&nbsp; Sight gags galore, goofy plotlines, aliens and the joys of getting a job have all been explored for the last 10 years and 100 episodes.&nbsp; Along with an all-star roster of guest stars (including Zakk Wilde, Glenn Danzig, David Cross, Bill Hader, Scott Adsit, and Fred Armisen); this show went from a show I didn't understand in the beginning (and HATED) to a show that I LOVE and will punch anyone in the face that says differently. <br /><br />(Not really, but I WILL try to ""box set bully"" you into liking it! haha)<br /><br />I come from the ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" school of thought and get VERY nervous when beloved shows decide to futz around with their storyline and characters; because it usually leads to it being its LAST SEASON. Like when Fonzie jumped the shark (Happy Days) or Cousin Oliver coming to live with The Brady Bunch.&nbsp; <br /><br />And boy, did they retool&hellip;and I am afraid because from what I'm seeing and hearing so far, I do not heart. <br /><br />Now renamed ""Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1"", we find the team going back to their roots and solving crimes - in Seattle.&nbsp; Yeah, that's what I said&hellip;followed by ""What about Carl? Better find a way to bring him, too, or this new show is toast.""<br /><br />I AM relieved to know that George Lowe (best known to AS fans from ""Space Ghost Coast to Coast"") will appear in every episode of the new season and reoccurring show openers Dr Weird&nbsp; (""Gentlemen, BEHOLD!"") and Steve will be returning as well. But there's a nagging question that goes with that: as Dr Weird's lab is located on the ""South Jersey Shore"", does this mean they'll be getting new digs on one of the islands near Seattle? <br /><br />In my experience, sometimes changing the theme to a show can help or hurt it.&nbsp; This season of U.S. of Tara (Showtime) has decided to get rid of their show's opening sequence and theme song altogether and in some ways, it kind of lost some of the magic that went with it, BUT when The Drew Carey Show changed theirs from an animated version of Drew singing the whimsical ""Moon Over Parma"" (which was MY fave) to Drew and fellow castrates lip-synching ""Cleveland Rocks"" (where the show was set) with a montage of the city and people of Cleveland; the ratings skyrocketed. <br /><br />When I think ATHF, I think of Schoolly D's BRILLIANT opening theme:<br /><br />

<p>Thanks to the people at Paramount, I got to see an early screening of THOR. I honestly expected THOR to be a great film... the casting, the director, the studio, all of the things involved in making THOR into a movie, added up to be a great film from my perspective. It was a great movie. There is really only 2 ways to go with THOR, either you make it really bad, or you make it great. Marvel hit another home run with this one. THOR IS A GOD. That's it. Don't make excuses, just accept that he's a god, and he's awesome.</p>

<p>Chris Hemsworth captured the character of THOR and delivers a great performance. It could be argued, that playing THOR could be harder than SUPERMAN, considering you are portraying a god.</p>

<p>The premise couldn't have been easy to navigate for anyone involved in production. Somehow, you have to know THOR as The God Of Thunder, but you also have to get him to Earth, and make him Donald Blake... and set up next year's THE AVENGERS. This was all done to perfection.</p>

<p>All I can do is highly endorse THOR. I think it's worth the price of a 2D movie ticket, possibly numerous times. I can't endorse the 3D though, it doesn't help, or hurt the film. This is a movie that needs no 3D, it only needs the might power of Mjolnir!</p>

Abin Sur gives Hal his  power ring &ndash; a device capable of creating anything Hal can imagine. &nbsp;Hal  discovers that the Green Lantern Corps are made up of hundreds of alien  races banding together as the universe&rsquo;s protectors of peace and  justice.</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #363636; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">When a new foe called Parallax threatens the universe, Hal  along with the encouragement of fellow pilot and childhood sweetheart,  Carl Ferris must master the ring and his courage to save the universe.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #363636; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">Directed by Martin  Campbell (Casino Royale) and starring Ryan Reynolds &amp; Blake Lively.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #363636; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">POWERS</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #363636; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">Hal Jordan is a  normal, physically fit, human test pilot. When Hal wields the Green  Lantern ring, (one of the most powerful weapons in the universe), he is  the greatest Green Lantern of them all, with an unmatched level of will,  courage and humanity.</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #363636; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">Using the ring, Hal can create solid  light objects of anything he can imagine. The most commonly used powers  includes a forcefield that allows protection from physical and mental  attacks as well as the vacuum of space. He can fly and is also capable  of interstellar flight. Offensively he can create energy blasts or  objects of solid light to attack with. The ring can also translate any  language and allows communication between fellow Corps members.</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #363636; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">FACTS ABOUT GREEN  LANTERN</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #363636; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three foot tall, blue skinned Guardians of the  Universe who live on Oa (the planet at the center of the universe - see  below) created the Green Lantern rings and grant them to worthy  candidates.<br /><br /></span><img src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/X6gawPfj0k94sv0isfLTP2mfqWVwg7DD0gRw705ia6wBre9OFC00tmgpeACLxTYSZ1C8NdKmNh6BQDPZyhsCbdRh3P2hNNhtzsFl8fnCCVpF-Wm2RTw"" alt="""" width=""580;"" height=""302"" /><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #363636; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">2.

Parallax is a  creature of pure fear that ages ago was imprisoned within the Central  Power Battery. This is why a Green Lantern&rsquo;s ring has a weakness against  yellow - because a Green Lantern has to overcome his fear to use the  full power of the ring.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #363636; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;""> TRIVIA</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #363636; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have  been a number of human Green Lanterns: Hal Jordan, John Stewart, Guy  Gardner, Kyle Rayner and Jennie Lynn Hayden daughter of the 1940s Green  Lantern, Alan Scott.

Rayner&rsquo;s job as a  comic book artist allowed him to create intricate giant robots, battle  suits Gatling guns and other complicated and fun objects that  reinvigorated the Green Lantern franchise in the 1990s.</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #363636; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">8.

Green Lantern is an  A-list comic book character in the industry thanks largely to the  efforts of Geoff Johns. His comic and his event spin-off title,  &ldquo;Brightest Day&rdquo; are the second, third, fifth and sixth best selling  comic books for March 2011.

<p>Even a great movie or TV show isn't above throwing in one ridiculous,  larger-than-life character who almost ruins any element of realism in  the plot. The genius who's <em>too</em> smart, the hero who's <em>too</em> cool, the rebel who breaks the rules but somehow never gets punished for it.</p>
<p>Hey, you know where else you find ridiculous characters like that? Real life.</p>
<div class=""subheading"">

<p><span class=""Title"">The Ridiculous Premise</span></p>
<p>We're so used to Sylvester Stallone playing sneering, invincible killing machines that we forget that the whole point of <em>Rocky</em> was that the guy was a vulnerable, everyday schlub who worked odd jobs  because he stunk at boxing. Hell, half of you reading this probably only  saw the sequels and don't even realize the original <em>Rocky</em> ended with him losing the match.</p>
<p><img src=""http://i-beta.crackedcdn.com/phpimages/article/3/0/2/56302.jpg?v=1"" alt="""" width=""316"" height=""241"" /></p>
<p>No, the inspirational -- and laughably unrealistic -- part of the  story was that this Philadelphia doofus and part-time boxer somehow got a  shot at the flamboyant world champ, <em>knocked him down</em>, then  went toe-to-toe for the duration of the fight, taking the best the champ  could dish out. At the end, Rocky's face is a swollen, bloody mess, but  he hangs tough and for one night proved he could hang with the best.</p>
<p><span class=""Title"">The Reality</span></p>
<p>The real guy's name <a href=""http://www.thesweetscience.com/news/articles/1298-don-t-bleed-for-me-bayonne"" target=""a"">was Chuck Wepner</a>.  In 1975 he was a liquor salesman in New Jersey by day, boxer by night.  And he got the same deal as Rocky. A lottery ticket of a fight that, if  he won, would make him the champion of the world. It was considered such  a big deal at the time that Wepner made the cover of Sports  Illustrated, despite the fact that he looked like this:</p>
<p><img src=""http://i-beta.crackedcdn.com/phpimages/article/3/9/3/56393.jpg?v=1"" alt="""" width=""212"" height=""282"" /></p>
<p>Remember how by the end of his climactic fights, Rocky's face always  looked like an animal you've never seen before had been run over by a  truck? And the unrealistic amounts of blood leaping off of Rocky's face  in slow motion every time he got punched? Wepner's boxing nickname was  ""The Bayonne Bleeder"" because his face would spurt blood pretty much the  moment a boxing glove touched it (Wepner had more than 300 stitches in  his face -- he was apparently not the most elusive boxer of his era).</p>
<p>Instead of Apollo Creed, Wepner simply had to face one of the best  boxers in the history of human civilization - Muhammad Ali. The champ  wanted an easy fight as a warm-up to a real match later, so we're  guessing he was looking at a list and picking between ""The Bayonne  Bleeder"" and a guy named ""Brittle Ribs Ranalli."" Ali and Wepner would  split the purse 94% to 6% in Ali's favor.</p>
<p>Just as in <em>Rocky</em>, Ali toyed with Wepner early on and just as in the film, Wepner knocked Ali down, shocking the boxing world.</p>

<p>Even a great movie or TV show isn't above throwing in one ridiculous,  larger-than-life character who almost ruins any element of realism in  the plot. The genius who's <em>too</em> smart, the hero who's <em>too</em> cool, the rebel who breaks the rules but somehow never gets punished for it.</p>
<p>Hey, you know where else you find ridiculous characters like that? Real life.</p>
<div class=""subheading"">

<p><span class=""Title"">The Ridiculous Premise</span></p>
<p>We're so used to Sylvester Stallone playing sneering, invincible killing machines that we forget that the whole point of <em>Rocky</em> was that the guy was a vulnerable, everyday schlub who worked odd jobs  because he stunk at boxing. Hell, half of you reading this probably only  saw the sequels and don't even realize the original <em>Rocky</em> ended with him losing the match.</p>
<p><img src=""http://i-beta.crackedcdn.com/phpimages/article/3/0/2/56302.jpg?v=1"" alt="""" width=""316"" height=""241"" /></p>
<p>No, the inspirational -- and laughably unrealistic -- part of the  story was that this Philadelphia doofus and part-time boxer somehow got a  shot at the flamboyant world champ, <em>knocked him down</em>, then  went toe-to-toe for the duration of the fight, taking the best the champ  could dish out. At the end, Rocky's face is a swollen, bloody mess, but  he hangs tough and for one night proved he could hang with the best.</p>
<p><span class=""Title"">The Reality</span></p>
<p>The real guy's name <a href=""http://www.thesweetscience.com/news/articles/1298-don-t-bleed-for-me-bayonne"" target=""a"">was Chuck Wepner</a>.  In 1975 he was a liquor salesman in New Jersey by day, boxer by night.  And he got the same deal as Rocky. A lottery ticket of a fight that, if  he won, would make him the champion of the world. It was considered such  a big deal at the time that Wepner made the cover of Sports  Illustrated, despite the fact that he looked like this:</p>
<p><img src=""http://i-beta.crackedcdn.com/phpimages/article/3/9/3/56393.jpg?v=1"" alt="""" width=""212"" height=""282"" /></p>
<p>Remember how by the end of his climactic fights, Rocky's face always  looked like an animal you've never seen before had been run over by a  truck? And the unrealistic amounts of blood leaping off of Rocky's face  in slow motion every time he got punched? Wepner's boxing nickname was  ""The Bayonne Bleeder"" because his face would spurt blood pretty much the  moment a boxing glove touched it (Wepner had more than 300 stitches in  his face -- he was apparently not the most elusive boxer of his era).</p>
<p>Instead of Apollo Creed, Wepner simply had to face one of the best  boxers in the history of human civilization - Muhammad Ali. The champ  wanted an easy fight as a warm-up to a real match later, so we're  guessing he was looking at a list and picking between ""The Bayonne  Bleeder"" and a guy named ""Brittle Ribs Ranalli."" Ali and Wepner would  split the purse 94% to 6% in Ali's favor.</p>
<p>Just as in <em>Rocky</em>, Ali toyed with Wepner early on and just as in the film, Wepner knocked Ali down, shocking the boxing world.</p>

<p>3D printed turrets! What is a 3D printer? Where can I get one?! I need to print all kinds of objects. Including, but not limited to, an ice cream sandwich and a Portal 2 turret. (<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/luiserodriguez/5625463274/in/photostream/"">via.  A turret egg cup. So simple, and yet, so creative.

<p>Portal bookends! These might be my favorite. The <a href=""http://www.etsy.com/listing/73703592/portal-bookends-reserved-for-pyrenus"">Etsy shop where they're being sold</a> has a waiting list, but they're still making them.</p>

<p>Lovingly (and, I'm guessing, patiently) crafted P-body and Atlas. Medium: Lego. Artist: unknown. Another great artist goes unappreciated in his/her time.

<p><a href=""http://vimeo.com/22804972""></a></p>
<p>Yet another turret that talks and has laser-like emissions, but this time, IT'S SUPER CUDDLY.  I'll stop there. There are plenty more Portal 2 crafts and arts coming every day. You know a game has some kind of special sauce when it inspires this kind of real life devotion. Nice job, Valve.</p>

<p>The Dark Knight Rises has wrapped its India location shoot, with director Christopher Nolan and actors Christian Bale and Josh Pence returning to England on Monday, leaving a trail of questions behind them.&nbsp;<strong>Warning:&nbsp;</strong>Potential spoilers follow.</p>

The question, however, is who goes into, or comes out of, the pit.</p>

<p class=""p1"">Coming soon to a PC near you!&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p1"">Thanks to the ever growing popularity of the HBO series ""Game of Thrones"",&nbsp; this morning, Cyanide Studio (makers of Blood Bowl) announced they will be releasing their new RTS title, ""A Game of Thrones: Genesis"" for the PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p1"">Based on the George R.R. Martin series of books, ""A Song of Ice and Fire"", GOT: Genesis promises to challenge your political, strategic, and military skills as you make your way through the Seven Kingdoms.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2""><a title=""GOT Storm's End seat of House Baratheon by popgalaxy, on Flickr"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/61215387@N04/5714535860/""><img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2555/5714535860_4726b89e49.jpg"" alt=""GOT Storm's End seat of House Baratheon"" width=""500"" height=""281"" /></a></p>
<p class=""p1"">Storm's End seat of House Baratheon</p>
<p class=""p1"">Players will find themselves right in the eye of the storm as they traverse the battles, intrigues, and 1000 years of origins and history between the Houses in the Kingdom of Westeros as told by the novels. From Nymeria's arrival to the Kingdom of Dorne to the ""Others"" beyond The Wall, players take part in the founding events and largest battles (such as Aegon the Conqueror's invasion of the continent or the War of the Usurper) that has shaped Westeros'&nbsp; current fate as we know it.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p1""><a title=""GoT The Eyrie house of the Arryns by popgalaxy, on Flickr"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/61215387@N04/5713997271/""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3085/5713997271_07ebb1481b.jpg"" alt=""GoT The Eyrie house of the Arryns"" width=""500"" height=""280"" /></a></p>

<p class=""p1"">Coming soon to a PC near you!&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p1"">Thanks to the ever growing popularity of the HBO series ""Game of Thrones"",&nbsp; this morning, Cyanide Studio (makers of Blood Bowl) announced they will be releasing their new RTS title, ""A Game of Thrones: Genesis"" for the PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p1"">Based on the George R.R. Martin series of books, ""A Song of Ice and Fire"", GOT: Genesis promises to challenge your political, strategic, and military skills as you make your way through the Seven Kingdoms.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""p1"">Storm's End seat of House Baratheon</p>
<p class=""p1"">Players will find themselves right in the eye of the storm as they traverse the battles, intrigues, and 1000 years of origins and history between the Houses in the Kingdom of Westeros as told by the novels. From Nymeria's arrival to the Kingdom of Dorne to the ""Others"" beyond The Wall, players take part in the founding events and largest battles (such as Aegon the Conqueror's invasion of the continent or the War of the Usurper) that has shaped Westeros'&nbsp; current fate as we know it.&nbsp;</p>

The greatest example of this Easter egg-laying is that of Odin&rsquo;s vault, a treasure room loaded with relics and mystic artifacts, items that mean nothing to your average moviegoer.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<em>Thor</em>, this room is important as it stores the Casket of Ancient Winters, the source of power of the Frost Giants, which, as we see in the film&rsquo;s introduction, was stolen by Odin (Anthony Hopkins).

<p>Sooo&hellip;tonight is the season finale of The Office and we've seen some interesting things go on this season that culminated in: the departure of Michael Scott (sob! cry! QQ!), the temporary reign of DeAngelo Vickers (who was then hoisted by his own petard, so to speak), Jim turning down the position of Interim Manager only to see Dwight being put in charge&hellip;until he discharges a firearm in the office, nearly injuring Andy and shifts the power BACK to the staff, forcing Dwight to show his hand to Jo when she comes to town and *DEEP BREATH*&hellip;forces her to relieve Dwight of his duties (NOT FIRED, just no longer in charge) and begin a search for a new manager.</p>
<p>And that's where we find ourselves tonight. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Jo recruits an interoffice search committee (comprised of Jim, Gabe, and Toby) to find the new branch manager and boy, do they have some interesting candidates that include Will Arnett, Jim Carrey, Warren Buffett (yes, THAT Warren Buffett), James Spader, Ray Romano, Ricky Gervais, AND&hellip;(to my delight) Catherine Tate.</p>
<p>Here's MY reasonings as to why you won't be seeing most of them drinking out of their OWN ""World's Best Boss"" mug at Dunder-Mifflin; and who I think WILL.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>First off, let's just eliminate any possible interoffice candidates. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Andy</strong> (Ed Helms) - cracks under pressure and by his OWN admission is a TERRIBLE salesman, not to mention he nearly brought down the company with the whistle-blowing of the combustible copiers last season.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kelly </strong>(Mindy Kaling) - What, are you kidding me?&nbsp; If Kelly took over, the office would look like Hello Kitty exploded all over it and the branch would most likely fold in less than 6 months as I suspect Ryan (BJ Novak) would fleece the company retirement fund and leave her holding the bag.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Darryl</strong> (Craig Robinson) - Yeah, no.&nbsp; Darryl has GREAT company ideas but I think the idea of running the company would be cool to him in name only to impress his daughter.&nbsp; T'would be fun to see Darryl mess with Dwight, though. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Danny Courdray</strong> (Timothy Olyphant) - Devastatingly charming and ridiculously good looking, Courdray is excellent at his job and EVENTUALLY Michael liked him but because of that tension that was built with the viewers, doubtful that he will be considered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now let's look at the frontrunners:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Will Arnett </strong>- Considering we've seen him play two different types of bumbling company men in TWO different shows, I gotta say ""Nope, nope, nope.""&nbsp; In Arrested Development, he was Gob Bluth -&nbsp; an amateur magician with even more amateur ideas to run the company; and in ""The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret"", he was basically Gob on steroids with a string of f-bombs attached.&nbsp; No matter what he does, Arnett will always be viewed as Gob Bluth and that will indeed carry over to The Office (just like Will Ferrell was basically his character from Step Brothers with a soup&ccedil;on of a-hole). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>(That, and Arnett's new pilot, Up All Night, was just picked up by NBC. So that's him, sorted.)&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jim Carrey</strong> - Sorry, Jim. I just don't see it.&nbsp; You're a brilliant character, comedic, and dramatic actor (trust me, I have been in near fistfights over defending your character in The Cable Guy) and have GREAT timing, but it's only a matter of time where you're gonna need time off to make a movie and this show needs someone who wants to be planted for a little while.&nbsp; That and the accent you're using in the commercials bugs absolute shiz outta me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Warren Buffett</strong> - C'mon people. This is the (new) Cookie Monster equivalent of putting Giuliani on SNL - good as a sometimes food and purely for ratings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ray Romano</strong> - Not gonna lie, I read his book ""Everything and a Kite"" and enjoyed it immensely. Romano is a great comedian and a great comedic actor but after nine seasons of Everybody Loves Raymond, CAN Romano pull off a show without a live studio audience telling him what is and isn't working?</p>
<p><strong>Ricky Gervais</strong> - He's already had a go and I'm sure he looks at David Brent these days as a ""sometimes food"" as well. As someone who was a fan of the U.K. version, I would see Brent's arrival as a way to tell viewers this is the last season - which would cause people to check out early. And I hear Gervais is booked up for the next year or so as well, so he's out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's kind of weird to speculate on a race where EVERY horse is the dark horse, but here's who I think we'll be looking at as Carell's possible successor.</p>
<p><strong>James Spader</strong> -&nbsp; Of all the men, Spader is my top choice.&nbsp; As far as a boss with Michael Scott/Dunder Mifflin type qualities, he's the one and if you were a fan of Boston Legal; you know it, too. Much like Michael Scott, Alan Shore became a formidable opponent when push came to shove and a likable guy&hellip;even with the peccadilloes.&nbsp; Spader also has an amazing way of bringing out the best of whoever acts opposite him in a scene, which is why Alan Crane and Denny Crane's (William Shatner) friendship on Boston Legal is in my Top 10 ""Bromances"".&nbsp; If he joins Dunder Mifflin, could prove for some interesting scenes between himself, Jim and Dwight. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was kinda funny; the last hour or so of sleep before waking, I start to figure out which direction I want my Frame Rate story to go in and found myself asking ""There's loads of males on that list, could they not find a female that could go toe to toe with these comedic heavyweights?"" and that's when I remembered that SHE was the one.</p>
<p>And that one is&hellip;<strong>Catherine Tate</strong></p>
<p><a title=""tate by popgalaxy, on Flickr"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/61215387@N04/5738318044/""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3533/5738318044_c435da8d04.jpg"" alt=""tate"" width=""500"" height=""370"" /></a></p>
<p>Fans of BBC America will recognize Tate from her role as Donna Noble in Doctor Who (Series 4) and as the writer/star of The Catherine Tate Show, which had a 22 episode run from 2004-2006.&nbsp; In TCTS, Tate plays multiple characters, both male and female) including a foul mouthed grandmother named Nan;&nbsp; a bratty teen named Lauren whose sole answer to anything is ""Am I bovvered (bothered)?"" or ""Look at my face, is my face bovvered?"". &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the one character in Tate's arsenal that immediately popped into my head when I remembered she was guesting on The Office was Ally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ahhhhhhhh, Ally!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>According to the wiki (and because I couldn't have said it better myself), Ally is described as ""</span>a tactless woman with good intentions who unfortunately is a perfect example of someone with foot-in-mouth syndrome. Unwittingly she offends all that she comes into contact with at parties, and then in an attempt to dig herself out of the ditch she has created, only worsens the situation.""</p>
<p>My favorite thing about Ally is when she's so far into that hole, she does this weird sing-song squeal that sounds like ""AHHHHHHHHH!"" as she races out of the room.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Watch these clips and TELL me she's not Michael Scott with breasts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So why her? Why do I think she's the one? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As weird as this is about to sound, it's because she is not a highly recognized name in the U.S. and I think that's her main advantage.&nbsp; Because of the popularity and iconic roles that the other men have built their careers on and will be associated with them for the rest of their lives, it can prove difficult when taking on a similar type role in ANYthing else.&nbsp; You can't help but compare them and then wonder if they really are the right fit. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Think the British version of Kristen Wiig and you have Catherine Tate. BOOM.</p>
<p>Tate is hilarious and extremely likable but can also raise that ""awkward moment/damage control save"" factor at the drop of a dime, a quality that is needed for a show like The Office. And if they cast her, they could get the Doctor Who fanbase as well, which could provide good numbers because next season could be viewed as a ""rebuilding year"". &nbsp; Luckily for them, they've got a couple months to figure it out, I just hope they make the right choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That SAID, tonight's finale should prove interesting,&nbsp; filled with awkward moments and awkward laughs - I'm so ready! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Frame Rate: BOSS BATTLE BEGINS IN 3&hellip;2&hellip;1&hellip;FIGHT!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>***What about you? Who do YOU think'll be bringing their own ""World's Best Boss"" mug to work next season? I'm genuinely curious to hear what you think, so tell me your thoughts below!</p>","<p>The Office: Boss Battle!&nbsp;<br />by&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.twitter.com/crixlee"" target=""_blank"">Crix Lee</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sooo&hellip;tonight is the season finale of The Office and we've seen some interesting things go on this season that culminated in: the departure of Michael Scott (sob! cry! QQ!), the temporary reign of DeAngelo Vickers (who was then hoisted by his own petard, so to speak), Jim turning down the position of Interim Manager only to see Dwight being put in charge&hellip;until he discharges a firearm in the office, nearly injuring Andy and shifts the power BACK to the staff, forcing Dwight to show his hand to Jo when she comes to town and *DEEP BREATH*&hellip;forces her to relieve Dwight of his duties (NOT FIRED, just no longer in charge) and begin a search for a new manager.</p>
<p>And that's where we find ourselves tonight. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Jo recruits an interoffice search committee (comprised of Jim, Gabe, and Toby) to find the new branch manager and boy, do they have some interesting candidates that include Will Arnett, Jim Carrey, Warren Buffett (yes, THAT Warren Buffett), James Spader, Ray Romano, Ricky Gervais, AND&hellip;(to my delight) Catherine Tate.</p>
<p>Here's MY reasonings as to why you won't be seeing most of them drinking out of their OWN ""World's Best Boss"" mug at Dunder-Mifflin; and who I think WILL.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>First off, let's just eliminate any possible interoffice candidates. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Andy</strong> (Ed Helms) - cracks under pressure and by his OWN admission is a TERRIBLE salesman, not to mention he nearly brought down the company with the whistle-blowing of the combustible copiers last season.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kelly </strong>(Mindy Kaling) - What, are you kidding me?&nbsp; If Kelly took over, the office would look like Hello Kitty exploded all over it and the branch would most likely fold in less than 6 months as I suspect Ryan (BJ Novak) would fleece the company retirement fund and leave her holding the bag.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Darryl</strong> (Craig Robinson) - Yeah, no.&nbsp; Darryl has GREAT company ideas but I think the idea of running the company would be cool to him in name only to impress his daughter.&nbsp; T'would be fun to see Darryl mess with Dwight, though. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Danny Courdray</strong> (Timothy Olyphant) - Devastatingly charming and ridiculously good looking, Courdray is excellent at his job and EVENTUALLY Michael liked him but because of that tension that was built with the viewers, doubtful that he will be considered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now let's look at the frontrunners:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Will Arnett </strong>- Considering we've seen him play two different types of bumbling company men in TWO different shows, I gotta say ""Nope, nope, nope.""&nbsp; In Arrested Development, he was Gob Bluth -&nbsp; an amateur magician with even more amateur ideas to run the company; and in ""The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret"", he was basically Gob on steroids with a string of f-bombs attached.&nbsp; No matter what he does, Arnett will always be viewed as Gob Bluth and that will indeed carry over to The Office (just like Will Ferrell was basically his character from Step Brothers with a soup&ccedil;on of a-hole). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>(That, and Arnett's new pilot, Up All Night, was just picked up by NBC. So that's him, sorted.)&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jim Carrey</strong> - Sorry, Jim. I just don't see it.&nbsp; You're a brilliant character, comedic, and dramatic actor (trust me, I have been in near fistfights over defending your character in The Cable Guy) and have GREAT timing, but it's only a matter of time where you're gonna need time off to make a movie and this show needs someone who wants to be planted for a little while.&nbsp; That and the accent you're using in the commercials bugs absolute shiz outta me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Warren Buffett</strong> - C'mon people. This is the (new) Cookie Monster equivalent of putting Giuliani on SNL - good as a sometimes food and purely for ratings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ray Romano</strong> - Not gonna lie, I read his book ""Everything and a Kite"" and enjoyed it immensely. Romano is a great comedian and a great comedic actor but after nine seasons of Everybody Loves Raymond, CAN Romano pull off a show without a live studio audience telling him what is and isn't working?</p>
<p><strong>Ricky Gervais</strong> - He's already had a go and I'm sure he looks at David Brent these days as a ""sometimes food"" as well. As someone who was a fan of the U.K. version, I would see Brent's arrival as a way to tell viewers this is the last season - which would cause people to check out early. And I hear Gervais is booked up for the next year or so as well, so he's out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's kind of weird to speculate on a race where EVERY horse is the dark horse, but here's who I think we'll be looking at as Carell's possible successor.</p>
<p><strong>James Spader</strong> -&nbsp; Of all the men, Spader is my top choice.&nbsp; As far as a boss with Michael Scott/Dunder Mifflin type qualities, he's the one and if you were a fan of Boston Legal; you know it, too. Much like Michael Scott, Alan Shore became a formidable opponent when push came to shove and a likable guy&hellip;even with the peccadilloes.&nbsp; Spader also has an amazing way of bringing out the best of whoever acts opposite him in a scene, which is why Alan Crane and Denny Crane's (William Shatner) friendship on Boston Legal is in my Top 10 ""Bromances"".&nbsp; If he joins Dunder Mifflin, could prove for some interesting scenes between himself, Jim and Dwight. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was kinda funny; the last hour or so of sleep before waking, I start to figure out which direction I want my Frame Rate story to go in and found myself asking ""There's loads of males on that list, could they not find a female that could go toe to toe with these comedic heavyweights?"" and that's when I remembered that SHE was the one.</p>
<p>And that one is&hellip;<strong>Catherine Tate</strong></p>
<p><a title=""tate by popgalaxy, on Flickr"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/61215387@N04/5738318044/""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3533/5738318044_c435da8d04.jpg"" alt=""tate"" width=""500"" height=""370"" /></a></p>
<p>Fans of BBC America will recognize Tate from her role as Donna Noble in Doctor Who (Series 4) and as the writer/star of The Catherine Tate Show, which had a 22 episode run from 2004-2006.&nbsp; In TCTS, Tate plays multiple characters, both male and female) including a foul mouthed grandmother named Nan;&nbsp; a bratty teen named Lauren whose sole answer to anything is ""Am I bovvered (bothered)?"" or ""Look at my face, is my face bovvered?"". &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the one character in Tate's arsenal that immediately popped into my head when I remembered she was guesting on The Office was Ally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ahhhhhhhh, Ally!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>According to the wiki (and because I couldn't have said it better myself), Ally is described as ""</span>a tactless woman with good intentions who unfortunately is a perfect example of someone with foot-in-mouth syndrome. Unwittingly she offends all that she comes into contact with at parties, and then in an attempt to dig herself out of the ditch she has created, only worsens the situation.""</p>
<p>My favorite thing about Ally is when she's so far into that hole, she does this weird sing-song squeal that sounds like ""AHHHHHHHHH!"" as she races out of the room.&nbsp;</p>
